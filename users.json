                    "body": "ABC News has canceled a planned debate in New Hampshire, after GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley said Tuesday that she would only step foot on the debate stage again if Donald Trump or Joe Biden is there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had five great debates in this campaign. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

It was the United States and Britain that were militarizing the Red Sea with their warships, he added.\n\n\"Our communication ... continues to clarify our position, and confirm that all commercial ships in the Red and Arabian Seas are safe, with the exception of Israeli ships or those heading to Israel, only and only,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has regularly denied having links to vessels that have come under attack in the Red Sea, and several international shipping lines have paused deliveries or switched to longer, most costly routes.\n\n\"Our position comes from religious, moral and humanitarian principles ... as well as in response to the calls of the people of Palestine ... to support the oppressed in the Gaza Strip,\" Abdulsalam said.\n\nThe U.S. military said on Sunday a U.S. fighter jet shot down an anti-ship cruise missile which the Houthis fired towards the USS Laboon in the southern Red Sea. \"There were no injuries or damage reported,\" the U.S. Central Command added.\n\nThe Houthi movement controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a U.S.-backed and Saudi-led coalition.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council on Wednesday demanded the Houthis immediately end attacks on ships in the Red Sea and implicitly endorsed a U.S.-led task force that has been defending vessels while cautioning against escalating tensions.\n\n(Reporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi, Editing by Louise Heavens and Andrew Heavens)\n\n View comments",

And U.S. intelligence agencies are gathering data on Hezbollah that suggest it could be considering attacks on both U.S. troops or diplomatic personnel overseas, two of the officials said.\n\nThe chance for an assault on U.S. soil is also growing as tensions in the region escalate, the officials said.\n\n\u201cHezbollah could draw on the capability they have \u2026 to put people [in] places to do something,\u201d one of the officials said, referring to a potential attack on the U.S. \u201cIt is something to be worried about.\u201d The official, like others in this story, was granted anonymity to talk freely about sensitive intelligence.\n\n\nOfficials declined to detail the specific kind of attacks Hezbollah could take but said that the Iranian-backed group has capabilities that other terrorist groups in the region do not. Individuals inspired by the Islamic State or al-Qaeda \u2014 but who are not directly connected to the membership of those terrorist groups \u2014 have carried out lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. and Europe, officials said. But Hezbollah has an expansive international network that would allow the group to use its operatives to carry out an attack in the United States.\n\nEither scenario \u2014 an attack domestically or on troops or diplomats overseas \u2014 would deal a blow to the Biden administration which has worked to prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from broadening into a wider regional war and to keep American forces out of the fray.\n\nIt would also likely draw Washington back into the Middle East at a time when it is trying to focus its national security resources on countering China and Russia.\n\nThe National Security Council, FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center declined to comment. But senior Biden administration officials have said publicly after Oct. 7 that it believed Tehran and its proxies were not seeking a wider regional war or a confrontation with the U.S.\n\nU.S. troops in the Middle East have already been attacked by multiple other Iranian proxy groups, including Harakat-al-Nujaba, an Iraqi paramilitary group. These militias have launched at least 127 attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. The U.S. has hit back multiple times, including a Jan. 4 drone strike in Baghdad that killed a senior militia member.\n\nIt is unclear the extent to which Hezbollah regularly coordinates with these other groups, but top intelligence officials in Washington have determined that it has the same aims of disrupting the American military\u2019s position in the region and seeks opportunities to strike U.S. troops.\n\n\nStill, Lebanese Hezbollah has so far avoided major attacks on Israel or U.S. troops since the most recent conflict kicked off. The group, however, does have a history of targeting Americans and U.S. interests overseas.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, two U.S.-based operatives allegedly surveilled American and Israeli targets in Panama as well as in New York City. And the Islamic Jihad Organization, which later became part of Hezbollah, attacked the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1983, killing 63 people.\n\nThe State Department has increased security at the embassy in recent weeks to stave off any attack on diplomats based in Lebanon, one of the officials said.\n\n\u201cThe Lebanon front is ready to kick off. And these Iranian militia are pounding the U.S. in eastern Syria and Iraq,\u201d said Andrew Tabler, who served as special envoy for Syria engagement at the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs in the Trump administration. \u201cIt's interesting that this is all going on in the background and people are focusing on the Gaza theater, but the war is actually much larger than that.\u201d\n\nHezbollah and Israeli forces have also clashed on the Israel-Lebanon border following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on Israel. In the latest clash, Israel on Monday struck Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, killing one of its top commanders. Hezbollah hit back Tuesday, attacking an Israeli army base with explosive drones, according to Reuters. Both Hezbollah and Israel have said they do not want the conflict to escalate but have also vowed to continue defending themselves should the other side strike.\n\nWhile so far Israel-Hezbollah tensions have been mostly limited to cross-border skirmishes, one U.S. official said there are concerns that the group could respond more strongly if Israel does not do more to slow the death toll in Gaza.\n\n\u201cIran, Hezbollah and their linked proxies are trying to calibrate their activity, avoiding actions that would open up a concerted second front with the United States or Israel while still exacting costs in the midst of the current conflict,\u201d Christy Abizaid, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said during a congressional hearing in October. \u201cThis is a very fine line to walk, and in the present regional context, their actions carry the potential for miscalculation.\u201d\n\n\nAmerican officials are working behind the scenes to deescalate tensions, two of the officials said, and to keep U.S. forces out of the fray.\n\nThe administration has backed a plan that would move Hezbollah forces away from Israel\u2019s northern border, allowing thousands of Israelis who fled the fighting to return home. But talks have stalled in recent days, one of the officials said.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of profound tension in the region,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday during his visit to the Middle East. \u201cThis is a conflict that could easily metastasize.\u201d\n\nTop intelligence officials have testified in recent months about the threats posed by Hezbollah, saying the group has significant capability to carry out overseas terrorist attacks and that its motivation to strike the U.S. has grown following the Trump administration\u2019s 2019 strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of one of Iran\u2019s top military units.\n\n\u201cThe arrests of individuals in the United States allegedly linked to Hezbollah's main overseas terrorist arm, and their intelligence-collection and procurement efforts, demonstrate Hezbollah\u2019s interest in long-term contingency planning activities here in the homeland,\u201d FBI director Chris Wray said in a congressional hearing Nov. 15.\n\n View comments",

Days later, Boebert released a statement apologizing for the incident, while citing her \"public and difficult divorce\" and saying she \"fell short\" of her values.\n\nBoebert, who narrowly won reelection in Colorado's 3rd district in 2022 by around 500 votes, announced in recent weeks that she plans to run in 2024 in a neighboring district more friendly to conservatives. In her statement to CBS on Sunday, Boebert said the alleged incident over the weekend is \"another reason I'm moving.\"\n\n\"Personally, this announcement is a fresh start following a pretty difficult year for me and my family,\" Boebert said in a video announcing the move last month. \"I had never been in politics before and I'd never been through a divorce \u2013 something I never intended to go through.

Ron DeSantis, who is also vying for the Republican nomination, followed suit late last year, saying that he would \u201creplace and supersede\u201d the Affordable Care Act with \u201ca better plan\u201d since \u201cObamacare has not worked.\u201d The law took plenty of heat during the fourth GOP presidential debate in November.\n\nHowever, it would be even tougher than it was in 2017 for Republicans to try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even if they secure control of the White House and Congress in this year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe nearly 14-year-old law is even more embedded in the nation\u2019s health care system than it was when Trump took office, vowing to eradicate Obamacare. But he and the Republican lawmakers who controlled Congress ultimately failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act after months of unsuccessful attempts to come up with an alternative.\n\nMost of the nation, particularly Republican voters and many GOP lawmakers, have moved on from trying to repeal and replace the law. And Trump\u2019s comments have given President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats the opportunity to once again skewer Trump and the GOP for trying to take away people\u2019s health care.\n\nWhile Obamacare had a rocky start, with enrollment coming lower than expected in the federal and state exchanges, insurers dropping out of the marketplaces and many Republican-led states refusing to expand Medicaid, it has since stabilized.\n\nMore than 40 million Americans now have health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, up from just under 27 million in 2017, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Obamacare\u2019s popularity increased after congressional Democrats enhanced the federal premium subsidies in 2021.\n\nMany more people benefit from the law\u2019s provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from being turned away or charged higher premiums by insurers, allow children to remain on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 and provide an array of preventive services at no cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re as close as we\u2019ve been to meeting the aspirational goals of 2010 for the ACA,\u201d said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+Consulting and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \u201cIt was still in its infancy in 2017. Now it has matured enough that it is stable and functioning.\u201d\n\nHere is why the Affordable Care Act would be more difficult to dismantle now.\n\nRecord interest in Obamacare coverage: More people are insured through the Affordable Care Act exchanges than ever before. Some 15.7 million people were enrolled in Obamacare plans in February 2023, up 13% from a year earlier, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the exchanges. Plus, 1.5 million more people enrolled between March and September 2023, compared with the same period in 2022.\n\nAmericans are continuing to flock to the exchanges for 2024 coverage too. As of mid-December, more than 15.3 million people had signed up for Obamacare plans in the states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, during this season\u2019s open enrollment period, which began November 1 and runs through mid-January. That\u2019s an increase of 33% from roughly the same period a year earlier.\n\nSpurring much of this interest are the hefty federal premium subsides that are available through 2025. Biden and congressional Democrats beefed up the assistance as part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and renewed the enhancement as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The expanded subsidies enable 4 out of 5 people to find a plan for less than $10 a month. Some 91% of enrollees were receiving subsidies as of February 2023.\n\nIn 2017, only 10.3 million people were enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nAlso, those signing up for coverage now have far more choice of insurers and policies than they did in 2017. Some 210 health insurance issuers are participating on the federal exchange in 2024. The average enrollee has just under seven issuers to pick from.\n\nBut there were only 167 issuers participating in 2017, and the average consumer had only three to choose from. Several large insurers, including Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, had announced they were scaling back participation in 2016.\n\nMore states implement Medicaid expansion: There are now 40 states that have adopted the Obamacare provision expanding Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults. That\u2019s nine more than in 2017.\n\nIn most of the states, voters forced resistant Republican-led legislatures to broaden Medicaid by approving ballot initiatives. Maine began the trend in 2017, though it wasn\u2019t implemented until a Democratic governor took office in 2019. Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Missouri and Oklahoma followed, with South Dakota becoming the latest to adopt Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in 2022.\n\nVirginia expanded Medicaid in 2018, while North Carolina did so on December 1. In each of these two states, Democratic and Republican officials worked together to adopt the provision after years of resistance by the GOP.\n\nNationwide, nearly 18.8 million newly eligible Americans were enrolled in Medicaid as of September 2022, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2017, that figure was 12.2 million.\n\nHigher favorability ratings: Nearly 60% of adults had a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act in May 2023, close to the highest share since the law was passed in 2010, according to the KFF Health Tracking Poll.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a difference from December 2016, when only 43% had a favorable opinion of Obamacare.\n\nAnother change: The law\u2019s future is more important to Democratic voters than Republican ones, according to a different KFF poll. Overall, 49% of voters said the issue is \u201cvery important,\u201d but breaking it down by party, 70% of Democratic voters felt that way, while only 32% of Republican voters did. Obamacare had been a key health care issue for GOP voters in the past.\n\nSupreme Court leaves law intact: After Congress failed to repeal Obamacare, a coalition of GOP-led states and the Trump administration tried to take it down through the US court system.\n\nThe states argued the act\u2019s individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional when Congress in 2017 reduced the penalty for not having coverage to $0. They also contended that because the mandate was intertwined with a multitude of other provisions, the entire law should fall.\n\nBut the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2021, saying the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case.\n\nThe case marked the third time the law survived a significant challenge in the Supreme Court.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alayna Treene and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this story.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n\n View comments",

Introduced by Republican Reps. Bill Dean (Xenia) and Jennifer Gross (West Chester), the \u201cIssue 1 Implementation Act\u201d would immediately dismiss lawsuits seeking to enforce the abortion rights amendment, vacate previous decisions related to it and allow for the impeachment of judges who accept such cases.\n\nHouse Speaker Jason Stephens previously dismissed the idea when Dean, Gross and two other Republicans vowed to introduce such legislation in November. But if passed, HB371 would throw implementation of Issue 1 into disarray \u2013 and would put the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban back on the table.\n\nNew Albany billionaire Les Wexner named in Epstein documents\n\nThe bill, introduced Wednesday, dictates that the General Assembly shall have sole authority over the rollout of Issue 1 \u2013 now Article I, Section 22 of the Ohio Constitution. Passed by nearly 57% of voters in November, the amendment prohibits bans on abortion before fetal viability, as determined by an individual\u2019s physician, and requires any restrictions after viability to promote the life and health of the pregnant person in the least restrictive way. It also establishes the right to make decisions about miscarriage care, fertility treatments, contraception and pregnancy.\n\nIssue 1\u2019s passage has all but cemented the fate of Ohio\u2019s \u201cHeartbeat Law,\u201d which bans abortions at about six weeks gestation \u2013 far before fetuses become viable at about 22-24 weeks. In mid-December, shortly after Issue 1 went into effect, the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed the state\u2019s appeal of a block on the ban, citing the \u201cchange of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIssue 1 doesn\u2019t repeal a single Ohio law, in fact, it doesn\u2019t even mention one,\u201d Dean said in November, when some Republican lawmakers announced their intent to introduce a bill like HB371. \u201cThe amendment\u2019s language is dangerously vague and unconstrained, and can be weaponized to attack parental rights or defend rapists, pedophiles, and human traffickers.\u201d\n\nHow much snow we can expect this weekend in Ohio\n\nA Hamilton County judge will decide whether to strike down the six-week ban as violating the state constitution, but HB371 would render that moot. It would also put Article I, Section 22 of the Ohio Constitution in a category of its own, making it the only constitutional provision that the courts of common pleas, appellate courts and the state\u2019s high court would be barred from hearing cases about.\n\nWhile the six-week ban nears its probable demise, there are more than 30 other laws restricting access to abortion in the state. Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to repeal some of those restrictions, including a 24-hour waiting period and stringent facility requirements for providers, but in a General Assembly controlled by a Republican supermajority, such a proposal is unlikely to garner significant support.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to NBC4 WCMH-TV.\n\n View comments",

Mitt Romney. Trump was the top choice for Republicans, while Biden was the most common choice for Democrats. Pence topped the list for independents.\n\nSixty-four percent of Republicans said Trump was a person of faith, up from 53% in October. Pence, at 56%, came in second.\n\nMore Republican voters said Trump was a person of faith than several of his opponents in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, including Nikki Haley (44%), Ron DeSantis (34%), Vivek Ramaswamy (22%) and Chris Christie (22%). Haley was raised Sikh, but converted to Christianity. DeSantis is Catholic and Ramaswamy is Hindu.\n\nThe poll was conducted Nov. 21-22, 2023, among 1,012 registered voters. The margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe results added context to a similar Deseret News/HarrisX survey conducted in October, where Trump was also the most likely politician to be called a person of faith by Republicans.\n\nIn the latest survey, voters were also asked whether they considered a list of politicians to be religious \u2014 separately from being a person of faith \u2014 and why.\n\nMost Republicans \u2014 62% \u2014 said Pence was religious, while only 47% said Trump was. And while only 13% of Republicans said President Joe Biden was a person of faith, 26% acknowledged he was religious.\n\nSixty-nine percent of Democrats said Biden is a person of faith; 72% said he was religious.\n\nWhen voters were asked why they considered Biden to be a person of faith or religious, most pointed to beliefs about his character: he has a strong moral compass (52%); he is honest and trustworthy (48%); and he makes ethical decisions (47%).\n\nIn contrast, those who said Trump was a person of faith or religious point to their perception of him as a defender of religious people or policies. Sixty-seven percent said Trump defends people of faith in the U.S.; 60% said he supports policies that focus on families; and 54% said he \u201ccares about people like me.\u201d\n\nThe least common reason for saying Trump is a person of faith or religious, expressed by only 26% of respondents, is that he is \u201cactively involved in religious and faith communities.\u201d\n\nMore GOP voters view Trump as a person of faith than view him as religious. When justifying calling him a person of faith, voters more frequently pointed to his actions on behalf of religious people, such as defending people of faith and supporting family-focused policy. Those who called him religious, however, were more likely to say he \u201copenly expresses his religious beliefs\u201d (57%) and is \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d (53%).\n\nTrump was the first U.S. president since Dwight Eisenhower to change his religious affiliation while in office. Though he was raised Presbyterian, Trump now identifies as a nondenominational Christian.\n\nTrump boasts massive support from evangelical Christians, who make up a significant portion of the Republican electorate. Many evangelicals credit Trump for nominating three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u201cNo president has ever fought for Christians as hard as I have,\u201d Trump said at an event in June. \u201cI got it done, and nobody thought it was even a possibility.\u201d\n\nFaith has become a central issue in the 2024 election. Trump\u2019s new position on abortion \u2014 backtracking from his former support for a federal ban \u2014\u00a0has caused some discomfort among evangelical voters. And he faces a religiously diverse group of GOP challengers.\n\nRelated\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\u2019s strange strategy to win over religious voters\n\nMeet the former Latter-day Saint missionaries helping a Hindu win over evangelicals\n\nMany conservative Christian voters seem to value a candidate\u2019s positions on key issues over their religious affiliation or practice. \u201cI think Donald Trump changed a lot of that, frankly,\u201d Jake Chapman, one of the Ramaswamy campaign\u2019s co-chairs in Iowa, said.\n\n\u201cI think some Christians (in 2016) probably were questioning whether or not they could vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Chapman continued. \u201cAnd yet, you have Donald Trump who who did a lot for religious freedom, who did a lot by putting good conservatives on the courts that helped overturn Roe v.

Ambassador Nikki Haley to respond to their invitations to the debate by Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNeither campaign confirmed they would attend.\n\nFour Republicans had qualified for the debate under previously announced criteria. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie previously confirmed participation -- then Christie left the race last week.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in the wake of Trump dominating the Iowa caucuses, Haley said in a statement that she would debate only Trump or President Joe Biden -- suggesting she would skip a showdown with rival DeSantis in New Hampshire ahead of its Jan. 23 primary.\n\n\"We've had five great debates in this campaign,\" the former South Carolina governor said. \"Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them. He has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\"\n\nHaley's statement came after a third-place showing in Iowa's caucuses where she got 19% of the vote -- behind DeSantis with 21% and Trump with 51%.\n\nMORE: Trump dominates with Republicans, and 5 other takeaways from Iowa caucuses\n\nAfter Haley's statement, DeSantis fired back, posting on X that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn't want to answer the tough questions.\"\n\n\"The reality is that she is not running for the nomination, she's running to be Trump's VP,\" DeSantis wrote.\n\nAppearing on CNN later on Tuesday, Haley echoed her statement. \"If he's [Trump] on that stage, I'm there.\"\n\nPHOTO: Republican presidential candidate former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at a caucus night party at the Marriott Hotel in West Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 15, 2024.

And that's his position until it's not.\"\n\nInstead, Trump has favored counterprogramming events such as rallies or televised interviews.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican has seen a consistent bump in polling since September, including recent polls that showed her narrowly ahead of DeSantis in Iowa and one that had her closing the gap with Trump in New Hampshire.\n\nThe narrow divide in Monday's caucus results between her and DeSantis means that no candidate can claim the clear mantle of Trump alternative.\n\nHaley has turned her focus to New Hampshire, where the GOP primary is set for Jan. 23. Haley's campaign is betting big on a performance next Tuesday that could propel her campaign forward.\n\nMORE: Nikki Haley's 2024 campaign has growing popularity -- and several recent 'stumbles,' experts say\n\nBoth Haley and DeSantis vowed to carry on after losing to Trump in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\"We're gonna make you proud, and we're off to New Hampshire,\" Haley told supporters Monday night.\n\nOn Monday night, Haley's campaign released a memo that said she would take on Trump and Biden and \"go the distance in a long campaign.\"\n\n\"The Iowa results and the New Hampshire polls show Donald Trump is more vulnerable than commonly believed. He is the polarizing figure he has long been,\" campaign manager Betsy Ankeny wrote in the memo. \"Trump and Biden are the two most disliked politicians in America.\"\n\nABC News' Nicholas Kerr contributed to this report.\n\nABC News cancels New Hampshire Republican primary debate originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\n View comments (8.4k)",

Ron DeSantis as the only candidate committed to Thursday's event in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had five great debates in this campaign,\u201d Haley said in a statement, released as she campaigned in New Hampshire. \u201cUnfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them. He has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nHer statement was released a day after the all-important Iowa caucuses, in which Trump marked a wide margin of victory over both Haley and DeSantis. With the two locked in a heated competition for second place in Iowa, Haley tried to make her electoral argument more about Trump than DeSantis, repeatedly echoing her refrain that her candidacy marks a turnabout from the \u201cchaos\u201d that follows the GOP front-runner.\n\nThe move also could be a result of the last debate which featured only Haley and DeSantis, in which Haley didn\u2019t perform as well as expected, and DeSantis ultimately ended up beating her for second place in Iowa.\n\nHaley had argued to caucusgoers that picking her gives Republicans a better chance to defeat Biden in November, pointing to survey data showing her with the largest lead among the GOP field in a theoretical general election matchup.\n\n\u201cOur intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Van Scott said in a statement.\n\nHaley's decision also casts doubt on another New Hampshire debate scheduled for Sunday on CNN.\n\nOn X, DeSantis said Haley \u201cis afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions.\u201d He accused her of \u201crunning to be Trump\u2019s VP\u201d and said that he looked \u201cforward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\u201d\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung on Tuesday called Haley a \u201cdesperate globalist who wants higher taxes, open borders, and China to dominate the United States,\u201d He added, \u201cThat's why the only people who are voting for her are Democrats who are trying to interfere in a Republican primary.\u201d\n\nHaley went head-to-head with DeSantis in the most recent GOP debate last week in Iowa, a two-hour brawl that left at least some of her supporters feeling that the former South Carolina governor had lost some of the above-the-fray attitude of her campaign thus far. More than a dozen times she referenced a campaign-run website that several caucusgoers said had seemed repetitive and caught Haley in a bout of \u201cname calling\u201d that was off-putting.\n\nWith the GOP campaign now shifting to New Hampshire, ahead of that state's primary next week, Haley has projected confidence that her commitment to the state and surveys showing her with support there will provide her campaign with the momentum needed to cut into Trump's strength. After her caucus night party, Haley boarded an overnight flight to New Hampshire, where she planned an event with Gov. Chris Sununu later in the day.\n\nBut DeSantis, breaking with tradition, instead flew directly to Haley's home state of South Carolina, saying last week the plan to make a brief appearance there before going to New Hampshire himself was intended to send a message to Haley that he would compete fiercely against her in her home state's primary next month.\n\nAlong the campaign trail in Iowa over the past week, reporters had asked Haley when she would commit to participating in Thursday's debate, hosted by ABC and WMUR-TV at Saint Anselm College.\n\nAfter his caucus win, Trump flew to New York, where he was expected in court for one of his multiple legal challenges, before heading to New Hampshire for a rally later Tuesday. He's skipped all of the primary debates thus far.\n\nAfter visiting the court, Trump will fly to New Hampshire to hold a rally Tuesday evening.\n\nNew Hampshire Republican Party Chairman Chris Ager told AP on Tuesday that invitations had been extended to both Haley and Trump to join DeSantis on stage for the debate.\n\n\u201cWe would love to see them all,\" he said in a text message. \"People in NH expect to see a local debate. Candidates who skip do so at their own risk.\"\n\n___\n\nHolly Ramer contributed to this report from Concord, New Hampshire.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\n View comments (711)",

Today, it is Republicans who are besotted.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in Iowa revealed a new depth to the reservoir of devotion inside his party. For eight years, he has nurtured a relationship with his supporters with little precedent in politics. He validates them, he entertains them, he speaks for them and he uses them for his political and legal advantage.\n\nThis connection \u2014 a hard-earned bond for some, a cult of personality to others \u2014 has unleashed one of the most durable forces in American politics.\n\nIowa Republicans, following the lead of party officials across the country, rallied behind the former president despite a list of reasons to reject him. Republicans lost control of the presidency, the Senate and the House during his four years in office. He failed to deliver the red wave of victories he promised in the 2022 midterms. He has been charged with 91 felonies in four criminal cases this past year.\n\nAnd they stayed with him even as they were offered viable alternatives: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a popular, young governor who embraced Trump\u2019s policies, and Nikki Haley, one of the Deep South\u2019s first female governors, who credibly promised she could win back voters Trump drove away.\n\nYet in the first chance Americans had to cast judgment on Trump since he tried to overthrow an election, many Iowa Republicans made clear they don\u2019t judge him. They adore him.\n\n\u201cTrump is not a candidate, he\u2019s the leader of a national movement,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who has advised Trump. \u201cNo one has come to grips with what\u2019s it like to take on the champion of a movement. That\u2019s why even as all these legal issues pile up, it just infuriates his movement and increases their anger unbelievably.\u201d\n\nThe risks associated with the kind of unusually strong hold Trump maintains on the party have already emerged.\n\nHe has encouraged supporters to view him as above fault or defeat, a mindset that can lead to the kind of political violence that shocked the nation during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Elevating charisma over character can open the door to the kind of authoritarianism that Trump has promised on the campaign trail this past year.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people that support Donald Trump really are fed up with democracy, representative democracy, they think that an authoritarian-style government would probably be preferable at this point, in order to save the nation or whatever,\u201d said former Rep. Charles Bass, a New Hampshire Republican who previously voted for Trump, but said he would not do so again. \u201cI don\u2019t think they feel threatened by having somebody who at least has the trappings of being more authoritarian than past presidents.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s win was resounding, the Iowa results suggest the party remains deeply divided over his return to power. Roughly half of Iowa Republicans voted for one of Trump\u2019s rivals, including about 20% who backed DeSantis, who finished in second, with Haley close behind.\n\nRepublicans who resisted Trump in Iowa included the party\u2019s youngest voters and anti-abortion-rights conservatives who backed DeSantis, according to entrance polls.\n\nSimilarly, Haley won moderate voters, Republicans who believed Trump lost the 2020 election, those who support a muscular foreign policy and the segment of the party that prioritized temperament in their choice for a presidential nominee.\n\nParty strategists and officials in other states caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from the votes of a narrow slice of Republicans in a small state. As the Republican nominating contest moves to New Hampshire next week, one poll this month showed Haley within striking distance of Trump. The state\u2019s voters tend to be more moderate and less religious, suggesting an opening for her.\n\nDeSantis\u2019 ability to threaten Trump is less clear. He marketed himself to voters as a Trumpian wunderkind, able to deliver America First policies without the drama and chaos that often trail the former president.\n\nBut MAGA Nation rivals the Queen\u2019s Guard when it comes to standing at the ready to defend their sovereign, and DeSantis was turned back as Republicans showed they are less interested in policies than they are the man.\n\n\u201cI know that he is picked by God for this hour,\u201d said Patricia Lage, an Iowa caucusgoer who spoke in support of Trump on Monday night in Carlisle, outside Des Moines. \u201cThere are things that he has done in the past, but we all have pasts.\u201d\n\nTrump has spent years tending to his voters \u2014 taking aim at their shared enemies and anticipating their grievances. He has compulsively tried to ensure that he was never out of step.\n\nThat preoccupation repeatedly drove his decisions in the White House, from refusing to wear a mask during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 to his opposition to striking the names of Confederate generals from U.S. military bases.\n\nMore recently, Trump has attacked DeSantis for signing a six-week abortion ban and avoided committing to a federal ban on the procedure, betting that his voters will either agree or forgive him for deviating from a core conservative priority.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, he has rallied their support amid unprecedented legal troubles in part by describing the prosecution of him as an attempt to silence them.\n\n\u201cYou and I have been in this battle side-by-side, together \u2014 and we have been taking on the entire corrupt system in Washington like no one has ever done before,\u201d Trump told Iowa supporters at a rally Sunday, adding that the political establishment and global elites \u201care at war with us \u2014 we have to fight.\u201d\n\nVoter anger at political institutions remains sky-high \u2014 a dynamic that explains what appears, at first glance, to be nothing short of a political magic act: The billionaire son of a multimillionaire has become the voice for working-class Americans.\n\n\u201cHis gift is that the average voter in Iowa, New Hampshire and state after state feels like he connects with them,\u201d said David Bossie, Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager in 2016. \u201cHe\u2019s a blue-collar billionaire.\u201d\n\nBoth DeSantis and Haley have tried to weaken Trump\u2019s ties to his supporters without issuing many direct attacks on Trump. But the race to emerge as the Trump alternative is becoming increasingly urgent, with limited time for the candidates to cement that standing.\n\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Haley supporter, lamented that much of his party had become \u201csort of a cult\u201d around Trump. He still considers himself a Republican, though, and views Trump as the interloper.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s a Republican,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cHe\u2019s a demagogue.\u201d\n\nDavid Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican operative opposed to Trump, said the former president\u2019s bond with his voters was unlikely to be replicated by other candidates. The party has become more populist and anti-establishment, but Trump\u2019s ability to capitalize on his celebrity status while harnessing the swirling mix of anger at elites, racial grievances and mounting distrust of political, judicial and international institutions was, for now, unique.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a unicorn in our party,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cRepublicans have become more populist and anti-establishment, but that doesn\u2019t mean the party will nominate Majorie Taylor Greene or Jim Jordan next. There\u2019s no going back to the old party.\u201d\n\nc.2024 The New York Times Company\n\n View comments",

Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice,\" Trump said in March.\n\n\"And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\" said Trump, who still insists baselessly that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was stolen from him.\n\nA few months later, he got more specific.\n\n\"I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, the entire Biden crime family,\" Trump said in June.\n\n\"I will totally obliterate the deep state, and we know who they are,\" he said.\n\nTrump faces four criminal indictments, including over his efforts to thwart the transfer of power to Biden -- a concerted drive that culminated in the violent attack on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\nFor his part, Trump insists he is a victim of political persecution and accuses Biden of trying to block him from winning another term.\n\n- 'Vermin' -\n\nTrump's opponents are warning Americans to take his language very seriously, recalling how his fiery rhetoric before and after his election loss helped lead to the stunning attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump is now referring to people jailed for taking part in the assault as \"hostages\" and has said that he is \"inclined to pardon many of them.\"\n\nIn December 2022 he charged that the fraud he insists took place in the 2020 election \"allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the constitution.\"\n\nThis remark caused an uproar as many in America came to fear Trump might suspend the constitution that US presidents pledge to uphold.\n\n\"We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections,\" Trump said in November.\n\nBiden slammed Trump's use of the term \"vermin\" as language echoing Nazi Germany and added: \"Damn, he shouldn't be president.\"\n\n- Muslim ban, tariffs and Ukraine -\n\nOn immigration Trump has said those arriving in the United States are \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" prompting more comparisons with Hitler's rhetoric.\n\nIf reelected, Trump also vows to sign a decree denying automatic citizenship to babies born of undocumented migrants as well as to carry out \"the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\"\n\nTrump also pledged to reinstate his controversial travel ban, which imposed restrictions on entry to people from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\n\"We will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's order in 2017 was quickly challenged in court as discriminatory and Biden reversed it in 2021.\n\nOn the economy, Trump has said he is considering imposing a 10 percent tariff on almost all imports into the United States and stripping China of special trade rights.\n\nTrump said he would manage to end the war in Ukraine \"in 24 hours\" but gave no details on how he would accomplish this.\n\nTrump's supporters in Congress are vehemently opposed to open-ended, no-strings-attached US military aid to Ukraine as it fights the Russian invasion.\n\nDuring his first term Trump repeatedly criticized NATO as freeloading off American largesse, and, asked recently if he would be committed to NATO in a second term, he said: \"Depends on if they treat us properly.\"\n\niba/rle/dw/md/bfm\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "It was perhaps the least surprising victory in the history of the Iowa caucuses.\n\nDonald Trump won by a landslide in the first contest in the Republican race for a presidential nominee, the margin in the end as comfortable as the polls had predicted for months.\n\nBut dominating the vote count was just one reason why the former president was celebrating on Monday night after his supporters braved extreme cold weather to deliver him the win.\n\nNeither of Mr Trump's main rivals, Nikki Haley nor Ron DeSantis, emerged as a lead challenger - so the not-Trump vote remains divided. Meanwhile, his most ideologically similar rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, announced he was dropping out - and will endorse Mr Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday.\n\nHere is a closer look at why the results in Iowa were so significant in the race for the White House.\n\nThis is still Donald Trump's party\n\nMr Trump's victory in Iowa was historically massive. He won the most votes in all but one of Iowa's 99 counties (he lost the other by a single vote).\n\nNo one had prevailed in an Iowa contest by more than 12 points before - Mr Trump's margin will approach 30% and he could end up winning an outright majority of the Republicans who turned out.\n\nWith almost all the votes counted, Mr Trump had won 51%, with Mr DeSantis on 21% and Ms Haley on 19%.\n\nA survey of Iowans entering caucus sites on Monday night helps explain exactly why his bid for an electoral encore has been successful so far.\n\nAbout half of Republican caucus-goers consider themselves part of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\n\nLive updates and analysis\n\nA very quick guide to US Republican primaries\n\nMr Trump's victory was a broad one as well. He won the young and old, men and women. He also won over the evangelical and hard-right conservative voters he had difficulty winning in 2016.\n\nTypically, defeated presidential candidates fade from memory, never able to shake the taint of the loss. Mr Trump, however, has managed to convince Republicans - here in Iowa and nationally - that he didn't lose.\n\nA large majority of caucus-goers in Iowa told CBS they believed Mr Trump was the actual winner of the 2020 presidential election - a number that increased to 90% among Trump supporters.\n\nTrump victory is a remarkable turnaround\n\nMr Trump's dominant position within the Republican Party has been irrefutable - but his win here, in the larger context of modern American politics, is extraordinary.\n\nThree years ago, he ended his first presidential term under a cloud of controversy, his campaign to challenge his loss to Democrat Joe Biden culminating in the January 6 Capitol riot. He faces two criminal trials stemming from those actions.\n\nNow, as the winner of the Iowa caucuses, he has taken the first significant step toward becoming the Republican Party's nominee in November's presidential election.\n\nDeSantis edges out Haley for second in Iowa caucuses\n\nVivek Ramaswamy drops out and endorses Trump\n\nTrump still has work to do to become the Republican standard-bearer. He will face a more formidable challenge from Ms Haley in New Hampshire next week, where polls show his once dominating lead has been whittled to near single digits.\n\nBut he is still the overwhelming favourite in the race, endorsed in his first test by actual Republican voters.\n\nNo clear rival emerged from Iowa\n\nEntering Monday's Iowa caucuses, most of the electoral intrigue involved which candidate would take second place behind Mr Trump. In the end, it was Mr DeSantis who walked away with the runner-up prize.\n\nIt's not much of an achievement, however, given the narrowness with which the Florida governor finished ahead of Ms Haley, after investing so much time and resources in Iowa.\n\nThe result, and Mr DeSantis's pledge to press on with his campaign, won't provide the kind of clear result that would set up a one-on-one face-off with Trump in the days ahead.\n\nTrump supporters were jubilant\n\nIn fact, the result may make Trump's victory all the more potent, as his divide-and-conquer strategy is still fully in place as the Republican primary process kicks into gear.\n\nThe one candidate who did drop out, Mr Ramaswamy, will further clear the field for the former president, as public opinion surveys show that his supporters have Mr Trump as their second choice. While he only garnered about 8% in Iowa, every bit of backing counts, and Mr Ramaswamy's endorsement will offer Mr Trump yet another headline to boost him into New Hampshire.\n\nThe Iowa result will also let the former president further focus his fire on President Biden, something he eagerly did during his victory speech on Monday night. For their part, the Democrats seem to be welcoming the showdown and the opportunity to exploit what they see as Mr Trump's vulnerabilities.\n\nA series of dominating wins, starting in Iowa, will give the former president momentum, however - and the air of a winner. By the time the autumn general election rolls around, Mr Trump may prove to be a more formidable adversary than they expected - or hoped.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nExplained: A simple guide to the US 2024 election\n\nAnalysis: Four surprises that could upend the election\n\nPolicies: What a Trump second term would look like\n\nGlobal: Why the world is watching so closely\n\n View comments",

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in second, with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley just behind in third.\n\nRamaswamy told supporters gathered at a Des Moines hotel that Trump \u201cwill have my full endorsement for the presidency.\"\n\nHe added: \"And I think we\u2019re going to do the right thing for this country. And so I\u2019m going to ask you to follow me in taking our America First movement to the next level.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his victory speech a few minutes earlier, said Ramaswamy \u201cdid a helluva job\" in the campaign. Ramaswamy said he would likely appear with Trump in New Hampshire Tuesday night and suggested DeSantis and Haley should \u201cfollow suit\" in withdrawing from the race.\n\nDuring the campaign, Ramaswamy needled most of his opponents but praised Trump as \u201cthe best president of the 21st century.\u201d He argued, though, that Republicans should opt for \u201cfresh legs\u201d while still supporting the America First agenda.\n\nThe approach, including his call for \u201crevolution,\u201d vaulted Ramaswamy into the mix of candidates vying to overtake Trump \u2014 or at least become a viable alternative. His decision to drop out, though, becomes the latest confirmation that the former president, even at 77 years old and under multiple criminal indictments, still dominates Republican politics and remains the overwhelming favorite to win the GOP nomination for the third consecutive time.\n\nRamaswamy\u2019s failure also affirms how difficult it is for any Republican other than Trump to push the bounds of party orthodoxy, as the first-time candidate found little political reward for positions such as his opposition to aid for Israel and Ukraine.\n\nRamaswamy said he would be open to vice presidential consideration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s going to be able to speak anyone\u2019s convictions but my own,\" he said. \"So if that\u2019s a role that I can perform from the vice presidency or any other one, I\u2019m going to evaluate whatever is best for the future of this country. But my No. 1 commitment is to truth.\u201d\n\nThe son of Indian immigrants, Ramaswamy entered politics at the highest level after making hundreds of millions of dollars at the intersection of hedge funds and pharmaceutical research, a career he charted and built while graduating from Harvard University and then Yale Law School. He brought to his campaign the same brash approach he used to coax money from investors even when the drugs he touted never made it to the market.\n\n\u201cDo you want somebody who grew up in this system who\u2019s going to deliver incremental reform? Or do you want somebody coming in from the outside?\u201d he said earlier in the campaign, framing his business success as a harbinger of what he could do in the Oval Office.\n\nIn a rapid-fire presentation on a range of issues, Ramaswamy wowed many GOP audiences by seamlessly mixing his biography and detailed policy positions with conservative talking points.\n\nHe advocated deporting the American-born children of immigrants who reside illegally in the country. He questioned the government\u2019s account of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and called for firing 75% of the federal workforce. He also called for raising the U.S. voting age. He hammered corporate America for its emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion. Ramaswamy called hawkish GOP rivals \u201cDick Cheney in 3-inch heels\u201d and laughed when one of them called him \u201cscum.\u201d But he always navigated Trump carefully, promising to pardon the former president for any federal crimes, including those related to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nYet alongside the bravado, Ramaswamy often ignored contradictory details, and his confidence sometimes brought him trouble.\n\nHe did not tell voters that he once described Trump\u2019s denial of his 2020 defeat as \u201cabhorrent\u201d or that he saw Jan. 6 as a \u201cdark day for democracy.\u201d He didn\u2019t say he invested in companies whose diversity, equity, and inclusion programs he calls \u201cwoke.\u201d His isolationist views and his assertions that U.S. politicians back Israel because of their personal financial interests drew the ire of influential conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity of Fox News.\n\nRamaswamy insisted he had a nobler purpose: \u201cI\u2019ll keep us out of World War III and then revive national pride in this country.\u201d\n\n View comments",

The rout further cemented Trump\u2019s status as the most likely candidate to face off against President Biden in November\u2019s general election.\n\nThe Associated Press called Iowa for Trump at 8:32 p.m. EST \u2014 just half an hour after the caucuses began.\n\nYet Iowans also braved snowy, subzero conditions to weigh in on which of the former president\u2019s remaining Republican rivals \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or former South Carolina governor turned United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley \u2014 had earned the right to be the GOP\u2019s top Trump alternative going forward.\n\nThey delivered a split decision, awarding both DeSantis (about 21%) and Haley (about 19%) a fifth of the vote \u2014 and all but ensuring that the two candidates continue to divide the party\u2019s anti-Trump faction in future primary contests.\n\nAfter 11:00 p.m. EST, the AP determined that DeSantis had finished in second place, narrowly edging Haley.\n\nGood news for Trump\n\nTrump set sky-high expectations for his performance ahead of caucus night, urging volunteers Sunday in Des Moines to \u201csee if we can get to 50%\" support \u2014 a bar no GOP candidate has ever cleared. With more than 90% of precincts reporting, Trump appeared poised to make history with 51% of the vote.\n\nPreviously, the biggest GOP margin of victory in Iowa was Bob Dole's nearly 13-point landslide over Pat Robertson in 1988.\n\nDonald Trump at a caucus night party in Des Moines on Monday. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Trump\u2019s record-setting win that made Monday such a good night for the former president. Haley also helped Trump by failing to finish in second place \u2014 an outcome that could have forced DeSantis from the race, allowing her to consolidate support ahead of next week\u2019s New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Ron and Nikki for having a good time together,\" Trump said in his victory speech. \"We're all having a good time together and I think they both actually did very well.\"\n\nDid Haley miss her chance?\n\nOnce seen as the GOP\u2019s likeliest Trump slayer \u2014 he led the former president in national surveys for a brief spell in late 2022 and early 2023 \u2014 DeSantis lost altitude soon after launching his heavily hyped campaign last May.\n\nHe had long staked his comeback on a strong showing in the Hawkeye State, visiting all 99 counties, landing the coveted endorsements of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats and organizing his supporters to knock on nearly a million doors.\n\nYet Haley \u2014 who had been mired in fourth in the Iowa polls, with just 4% support \u2014 rocketed ahead of DeSantis in the state\u2019s final surveys after several solid debate performances.\n\nRon DeSantis at a campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, on Sunday. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nSeeking a knockout punch, Haley\u2019s campaign and her allied super-PAC combined to spend more on Iowa advertising over the last two weeks than any other candidate: a full $7.8 million compared to $6.1 million for DeSantis and just $3.5 million for Trump.\n\nFor DeSantis, even a narrow loss to Haley would have come as a devastating blow. In New Hampshire \u2014 which holds its primary next Tuesday, Jan. 23 \u2014 the Floridian (who averages 6% in the polls there) trails far behind both Haley (30%) and Trump (43%).\n\nInstead, squeaking out a second-place result will give DeSantis a reason to continue campaigning in New Hampshire and beyond.\n\nTo that end, DeSantis finance chair Roy Bailey said Monday that the campaign has \u201cplenty of fuel in the tank to get the job done ... into Super Tuesday\u201d \u2014 the big pileup of 15 GOP primaries on March 5 \u2014 assuming they \u201chave the success I think we can have in Iowa and exceed expectations.\u201d\n\nOnward to New Hampshire\n\nHaley remains the only candidate within striking distance of Trump in the Granite State, where the state\u2019s independent-minded electorate has gravitated toward her over DeSantis.\n\nHaley also averages double DeSantis\u2019s support \u2014 25% versus 12% \u2014 in her home state of South Carolina, which votes fourth on Feb. 24.\n\n\"At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running; I was at 2% in the polls,\" Haley said in her speech Monday night. \"The pundits will analyze the results from every angle. We get that. But when you look at how we're doing in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and beyond, I can safely say that Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race.\"\n\nExperts have long seen New Hampshire, which allows \u201cundeclared voters\u201d to cross over and participate in party primaries, as the best place for a Trump challenger to gain momentum. The fewer non-Trump candidates on the ballot, the thinking goes, the more support will accrue to the last man \u2014 or woman \u2014 standing.\n\nNikki Haley, center, greets supporters during a campaign event in Des Moines. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nSimilar logic led former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose New Hampshire poll numbers were about twice as high as DeSantis\u2019s, to end his campaign last week. \u201cI am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again,\u201d Christie said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s more important than my own personal ambition.\u201d\n\nBut DeSantis won't follow in Christie\u2019s footsteps after finishing ahead of Haley in Iowa.\n\n\"You helped us get a ticket punched out of the Hawkeye State,\" the Florida governor told supporters in his speech Monday night. \"We have a lot of work to do. But I can tell you this: As the next president of the United States, I am gonna get the job done for this country.\"\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s Trump who will emerge from Iowa in a stronger position than ever.\n\nWhy Iowa went for Trump\n\nDespite lower-than-usual turnout due to weather, an estimated 120,000 Iowans still showed up \u2014 and the lion\u2019s share caucused for a figure who faces four criminal trials on 91 felony charges ranging from election interference to hoarding classified documents.\n\nWhy? According to the AP's VoteCast survey, a full three-quarters of Iowa caucus-goers said the charges against Trump are political attempts to undermine him rather than legitimate attempts to investigate alleged crimes.\n\nNearly two-thirds (63%) of respondents to the National Election Pool entrance poll said that Trump would still be fit to serve as president if convicted of a crime \u2014 double the number who said the opposite (32%). And among white evangelicals, Trump\u2019s support \u2014 just 22% in 2016 \u2014 soared to 53% this time around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here in part out of spite,\u201d Marc Smiarowski, a 44-year-old public utility worker, told the AP at Trump's final pre-caucus rally Sunday in Indianola. \u201cI can\u2019t abandon him. [With] the political persecution he faces, I feel like I owe him this.\u201d\n\n View comments (39.3k)",

The phrase \"security assurances\" is problematic for Ukraine because it was used in the title of the notorious Budapest Memorandum. For this reason, Ukraine is adamant about adopting \"security guarantees\", something that its international partners are not prepared for.\n\nIt is worth noting that the text of the agreement published on Friday does not contain any of these terms. Instead, the document refers to \"security cooperation\" and \"security assistance\".\n\nSupport UP or become our patron!\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "Nigeria's first lady has joined the chorus of voices condemning the killing of a student abducted along with her five sisters, calling it a \"devastating loss\".\n\nNabeeha Al-Kadriyar, 21, was \"super-bright, smart and kind\", her cousin Asiya Adamu told the BBC on Monday.\n\nNabeeha also loved to write poetry and read books by the American author Jodi Picoult - and she was days away from graduating with a science degree from Ahmadu Bello University.\n\n\"On the day the kidnapping happened, I asked Nabeeha if we were going to the [graduation ceremony] together, and she said yes,\" recalls Ms Adamu. It was the last time she saw her alive.\n\nThat evening, on 2 January, Nabeeha was abducted along with her father and sisters from their home in the outskirts of the capital, Abuja.\n\nNigerian police have not confirmed what happened next. Witnesses say Nabeeha's uncle ran to find help but was ambushed and killed, as were three police officers. It is not known why the family was targeted.\n\nThe kidnappers demanded to be paid a huge sum of cash by 12 January, and when they did not get it they killed Nabeeha as a warning, according to a member of the family who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity.\n\nNabeeha's kidnappers handed over her body and, in accordance with Islamic rites, she was swiftly buried by her family on Saturday.\n\nA national reckoning\n\nNews of Nabeeha's plight began to circulate over the weekend, prompting widespread grief and indignation that Nigeria's kidnapping crisis rages on despite government promises to bring it to an end.\n\nThis moment of reckoning has moved the president's wife to speak out and confirm Nabeeha's death, even though police had not yet officially done so.\n\nSecurity agencies must \"intensify their efforts\" to end Nigeria's kidnapping and security crisis, said First Lady Remi Tinubu on Monday, demanding a \"swift return of the Al-Kadriyar sisters\".\n\nTheir father Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, who was freed days ago in order to fetch the ransom money, now faces an agonising wait for their return. His daughters' captors are demanding a higher sum of 65m naira ($68,000; \u00a353,000), to be paid by Wednesday.\n\nHundreds of Nigerians have been kidnapped for ransom in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. Close to 20 people were abducted in in the first week of 2024 alone.\n\nNo matter how desperate the circumstances, Nigerian law prohibits the payment of ransom money. However, many victims pay up because they do not trust authorities or their track record.\n\nEven a former minister appears to share this scepticism of the Nigerian state's ability to bring the abducted back.\n\n\"I am personally not in support of paying ransom to criminals. However... I spoke with a friend who offered to pay the remaining 50 million naira,\" says ex-Digital Economy Minister Isa Ali Pantami, who is now a professor in cybersecurity, and a Muslim cleric.\n\nHe was one of the architects of the policy of registering all mobile phone Sim cards, in order to make life harder for kidnappers and extortionists, but says he is \"frustrated\" that it has not been better implemented despite allegedly enduring \"threats to my life\".\n\nNabeeha's cousin, Asiya Adamu, has also crowdfunded money from well-wishers online to help pay the ransom. She did not respond to the BBC's request to disclose the total raised, saying security officers had advised her not to so.\n\nMap\n\nWhile she prays for the safe return of the rest of her cousins, Ms Adamu is haunted by the thought that she narrowly avoided the same fate. She tells the BBC she was due to spend time at their house that day but later changed her mind.\n\n\"My favourite memories of Nabeeha was mostly when we were in the kitchen together,\" Ms Adamu recalls.\n\n\"Losing her has left a void one cannot explain with words. She was a source of comfort and understanding and I've lost that,\" she adds.\n\n\"She had plans of going to Morocco for her Masters because she liked the place.\n\n\"I guess we make plans and Allah has the last word.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n'How I survived my train hijacking'\n\nWhy Nigeria wants to jail those who pay ransoms\n\n'I saw my two-year-old carried by a man with a gun'\n\nThe motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria\n\n View comments (9)",

                    "body": "A North Carolina man has been found guilty of committing hate crimes against two men based on their race.\n\nOn Jan. 11, a federal jury reached a guilty verdict after finding that the defendant deliberately utilized KKK and Nazi memorabilia and other items to engage in intimidation by threatening the two victims with firearms, a violation of their civil rights.\n\nThe Justice Department charged Marian Hudak, 52, with deliberately causing harm, intimidating, or interfering with an individual identified as J.S., a Black man, based on his race and color. These actions occurred while J.S. was utilizing a public facility on Oct. 13, 2022.\n\nMarian Hudak faces federal charges, accused of federal hate crimes. (Photos: WSOC-TV/YouTube, Court Documents)\n\nAccording to court documents, Hudak started harassing J.S. while the Greensboro native was driving in Concord, N.C., and blasted the Black man with racial slurs and called out to him, \u201cCome here, boy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the verbal harassment, Hudak swerved into the lane the Black man was driving in, got out of his vehicle, and then repeatedly punched the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s side window. When the man tried to escape, Hudak chased him to his home, where he compounded the racial slurs and aggressive language by threatening to shoot and kill him.\n\nHe was also charged and convicted of willfully injuring, intimidating, or interfering with a Hispanic man named J.D. Prosecutors were able to prove that Hudak targeted his neighbor J.D. because of his race and national origin, violating his right to live wherever he wanted by intimidating.\n\nOn Nov. 27, 2021, Hudak attacked his J.D. outside of his home, blanketing him with racial epithets and insults before punching and tackling him down.\n\nReports state that the Hispanic man suffered bodily injury.\n\nDuring the trial, witnesses testified that the incident involving J.D. was not the first time Hudak used anti-Hispanic comments in public. In fact, the prosecutor was able to substantiate his bigotry by sharing items such as a KKK flag, a racist publication, and Nazi memorabilia discovered in his residence.\n\nOver the last few years, politicians and law enforcement agents in the Greensboro area have been cracking down on hate speech and related crimes. In 2020, the Greensboro City Council even took steps to apologize for racial terrorism that happened 44 years ago by voting to issue a formal apology for the massacre that left five dead at the hands of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan during a \u201cDeath to Klan Rally\u201d on Nov. 3, 1979, organized by Communist Workers Party activists.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center, across all 50 states, there are 733 active hate groups in the nation. North Carolina, particularly in areas like Charlotte, Durham, Fayetteville, Greensboro, Raleigh, Wilmington, and Winston-Salem, ranks as number 19 on the 20 states with the most hate groups.\n\nThe Justice Department has taken strides under Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division to fight against those domestic terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to use racial slurs and harbor the KKK\u2019s flag, but carrying out acts of violence fueled by naked racial animus and hatred violates the law and core principles of our democracy. The defendant was held accountable for his violent and unlawful attacks on Black and Hispanic members of his community,\u201d said Clarke, according to a Department of Justice press release.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department will vigorously investigate and prosecute violence targeting people because of their race or national origin. All community members should be able to live in and move about their neighborhoods without fear of attack because of how they look or where they are from,\u201d\u00a0Clarke added.\n\nHudak\u2019s sentencing hearing has been scheduled for May 1.\n\n View comments (14)",

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

In the town of Khan Younis in the south of the Palestinian territory, the military said it had killed two armed fighters.\n\nThe information could not initially be independently verified.\n\nThe war was triggered by an attack by terrorists from the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement and other militant groups on Israel on October 7.\n\nMore than 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others were taken hostage to the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with massive airstrikes and a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAccording to the Hamas-controlled health authority there, more than 24,000 people have been killed and more than 60,000 injured since then. According to Israel's army, around 9,000 members of Hamas and other terrorist organizations have been killed since the start of the war.\n\nIn view of the high number of civilian casualties and the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the sealed-off coastal area, Israel has come under increasing international criticism.\n\nA Palestinian man walks past the destroyed buildings of a school in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in Gaza City, after one hundred days of the Isarel-Hamas war.

If not, they could apply to settle in Rwanda on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\".\n\n\"Anyone entering the UK illegally\" after 1 January 2022 could be sent there, with no limit on numbers, the government said.\n\nMinisters argue the Rwanda plan would deter people arriving in the UK on small boats across the English Channel.\n\nHowever, when the scheme was first announced, the most senior civil servant in the Home Office said there was little evidence the plan would have a deterrent effect\"significant enough to make the policy value for money\".\n\nNo asylum seeker has yet been sent to Rwanda, which is a small land-locked country in east-central Africa, 4,000 miles (6,500km) from the UK.\n\nThe first flight was scheduled to go in June 2022, but was cancelled after legal challenges.\n\nA line chart shows the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats each year from 2020 to 2024 so far. There were 8,466 detected in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, with 45,774 in 2022 and 24,830 in 2023. As of 14 January, there have been 263 so far in 2024. Source: Home Office.\n\nHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?\n\nWhat was the Supreme Court ruling and is Rwanda safe?\n\nIn November 2023, the UK Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Rwanda scheme was unlawful.\n\nIt said genuine refugees sent there would be at risk of being returned to their home countries, where they could face harm.\n\nThis breaches the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment. The UK is a signatory to the ECHR.\n\nThe ruling also cited concerns about Rwanda's poor human rights record, and its past treatment of refugees.\n\nThe Supreme Court said that in 2021 the UK government had itself criticised Rwanda for its \"extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture\". It also highlighted an incident in 2018, when Rwandan police opened fire on protesting refugees.\n\nHow the UK's asylum deal is viewed in Rwanda\n\nLand of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion\n\nWhat is in the new Rwanda bill?\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, the government introduced a new bill to make clear in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country.\n\nThe legislation - which must be approved by Parliament - orders the courts to ignore key sections of the Human Rights Act, in an attempt to sidestep the Supreme Court's judgment.\n\nIt also orders the courts to ignore other British laws or international rules - such as the international Refugee Convention - that stand in the way of deportations to Rwanda.\n\nWhy are some Tory MPs unhappy about the Rwanda bill?\n\nThe bill passed its first vote in Parliament in December 2023, but on 16 and 17 January, a second round of voting takes place.\n\nSome Conservative politicians are unhappy with the proposed law and think it should go further.\n\nOthers have criticised the legislation because they believe it breaks international law.\n\nSunak gears up for battle on Rwanda bill\n\nCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?\n\nWhat does the new treaty with Rwanda say?\n\nAs well as introducing the Rwanda safety bill, the UK government also signed a new migration treaty with Rwanda.\n\nHome Secretary James Cleverley says it guarantees that any people sent to Rwanda to claim asylum would not be at risk of being returned to their home countries.\n\nIt also includes a new independent monitoring committee to ensure Rwanda complies with its obligations, and that British judges are included in a new appeals process.\n\nWhat will the Rwanda plan cost?\n\nThe UK government says it has paid \u00a3240m to Rwanda so far.

                    "body": "There\u2019s been a lot of criticism of the Royal Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers lately, some of it from me. Naturally I stand by what I\u2019ve written: but the pile-on has included a lot of suggestions which were misleading, or just plain wrong.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the criticisms which are levelled against aircraft carriers.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s suggested that aircraft carriers in general are obsolete. This is typically said to be a consequence of ballistic anti-ship missiles such as China\u2019s well-known DF-21D. Army officers, air force officers and journalists perennially believe that these are a recent thing, but they aren\u2019t. The first ballistic anti-ship missile, the Soviet R-27K, went into service in 1975. People went on building carriers, including the Russians. China, the nation which knows best just how good the DF-21D is, is building bigger and bigger carriers.\n\nOne reason carriers carried on is that ballistic weapons, like other missiles, can be shot down. The US has long had warships capable of ballistic defence, and we plan to upgrade ours to do this too. There\u2019s no mad rush about it, because we aren\u2019t fighting China right now.\n\nYes, Iran and its Houthi pawns have ballistic missiles, and some of them have seekers which are supposed to let them lock on to a moving ship as they descend, but this is a difficult technical challenge and these are not DF-21Ds. They are much smaller, much less powerful and they have improvised optical guidance rather than proper radar seekers. One of them appears to have struck a US-owned container ship yesterday, but the vessel has reported \u201cno significant damage\u201d and is continuing on its way. These are not \u201ccarrier killers\u201d.\n\nThis is why a US carrier and a fleet of international warships, many of them without ballistic defence, are happily operating well within the footprint of Houthi ballistics and other weapons in the Red Sea right now. Not to mention quite a lot of merchant shipping, still.\n\nThe second major point to bear in mind about any kind of missile you might shoot at a ship is that even if the missile is a proper anti-ship one that can lock on to and hit a moving vessel, you need some idea where the ship is to begin with.\n\nThe carrier may be well within the potential range of your missile, but if you haven\u2019t got a decent idea where in that potentially vast area of ocean it is \u2013 and where it will have moved to once your missile has got there, which might take some time for a cruise missile \u2013 you still can\u2019t usefully take a shot.\n\nUntil last week the Houthis had coastal radar stations which could track and target ships some distance out to sea, say thirty miles. They probably don\u2019t have any left now: if they do, they will be detected as soon as they switch on and promptly destroyed, as happened to a Houthi radar which had escaped the initial strikes on Saturday.\n\nRadar in an aircraft is much better than radar down on the surface, as it can see much further \u2013 hundreds of miles. A well equipped enemy can send out a radar plane to look for a carrier offshore. But because of the inescapable curvature of the Earth, the carrier\u2019s own radar aircraft will detect the searcher long before it can find the ship. The searching aircraft will run into some carrier fighters shortly after that.\n\nIt\u2019s often suggested that carriers can be located by satellites, and this would be relevant if we were talking about Russia or China. However this only works in sharply limited circumstances such as the carrier passing through a strait or chokepoint, and not always then.\n\nThe problem is that satellites, being solar powered, can\u2019t have a radar powerful enough to be useful from orbit \u2013 and optical sensors only offer a \u201cdrinking straw\u201d view. If you know where to look optics can identify a carrier, but knowing where to look is the whole problem. And since satellites in low orbit can\u2019t remain above a point on the surface, you can\u2019t use them to keep a ship under continuous observation.\n\nSo in fact, carriers are very difficult to target and they can operate well within enemy missile footprints, as the USS Dwight D Eisenhower is doing right now. Carriers are not obsolete; and no, hypersonic missiles won\u2019t change that.\n\nAircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales in Portsmouth harbour, where they are right now - Christopher Pledger\n\nThe next criticism of the Royal Navy\u2019s carriers is that they were staggeringly, unbelievably expensive. British Army officers in particular have a deeply entrenched belief that our carriers are the reason for the Ministry of Defence\u2019s ongoing budgetary \u201cblack hole\u201d, a problem which has dogged it for 25 years and shows no sign of going away.\n\nThe two ships started costing money in the late noughties, well after the black hole appeared, and total acquisition cost was a bit over \u00a36bn depending what figure you choose. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not a lot of money for an MoD equipment project.\n\nFor context, the RAF\u2019s Eurofighter Typhoon jets started costing real money back in the 90s and acquisition costs eventually reached at least \u00a323bn. Deliveries finally completed in 2019. Support costs to 2030 have been estimated at another \u00a313bn.\n\nThat isn\u2019t even to mention the huge extra sums spent and to be spent on new bells and whistles for the relatively small number of Typhoons \u2013 90-plus out of 160 delivered \u2013 which the RAF can afford to maintain in potentially flyable condition.\n\nMore than any other single thing, it was the Eurofighter \u2013 not the carriers \u2013 which pushed the MoD into its budgetary black hole and is keeping it there today. If Army officers want to hate something, they really ought to consider Typhoon. Another excellent candidate for their ire would be the Voyager tanker aircraft (\u00a311.4bn).\n\nOfficers on the bridge of destroyer HMS Diamond as she engages Houthi missiles and drone with her Aster (Sea Viper) interceptors on Jan 10 - UK Ministry of Defence\n\nAnd to be fair it\u2019s not just the RAF and the navy that have expensive equipment problems. The Army\u2019s new Ajax tanks were planned to cost \u00a35.5bn and arrive in 2017. Well over half the money has been spent but not a single working tank has yet been successfully tested. Ajax might be delivered by the end of the decade, more than ten years late. Delays like this cost money, and it will be a miracle if Ajax alone doesn\u2019t wind up costing more than the carriers.\n\nSo no, the carriers were not particularly expensive, and they are not the reason for the MoD\u2019s long-running financial paralysis.\n\nAnother, completely valid, criticism of the Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales is that they don\u2019t have catapults and arrester wires. This means that they cannot operate fully capable warplanes with full loads of fuel and weapons.\n\nThe only plane that can fly from them is the F-35B jump jet, which carries less than other fighters because of its heavy, bulky vertical lift equipment. Given that the Red Sea is barely a hundred miles wide off Yemen, however, it would be pretty mad to suggest that even short-ranged F-35Bs can\u2019t be highly effective against the Houthis from a carrier off the coast.\n\nIn any case the navy should not be blamed for the carriers\u2019 lack of catapults. That is the fault of an army man, General Sir David (now Lord) Richards, and a cabal of 12 other senior MoD mandarins, who made sure the ships did not get catapults in a secretive Whitehall campaign a decade ago.\n\nThe 13 mandarins claimed that this would save billions, but their figures on the cost of the catapults were deeply unconvincing and in fact their decision is costing the nation vast sums. This is because the jump jet F-35B is much more expensive to buy and fly than the tailhook F-35C \u2013 and vastly, madly, wildly more expensive still than the F-18 as used by the US Navy and Tom Cruise, which is still available to buy.\n\nThe F-35B\u2019s crippling expense is the reason why we send our carriers to sea with just eight jets aboard vessels designed to carry 36.\n\nIt\u2019s a fixable problem: the carriers were designed from the outset so that they could have catapults added at any point in their lives, and they will eventually get them.\n\nMeanwhile eight jets isn\u2019t nothing: and the great thing about jets on a carrier off the coast is that they can patrol over Yemen for long periods of time and strike targets quickly as they appear. The RAF\u2019s land-based Typhoons, by contrast, can only hit a target at four hours\u2019 notice after a longhaul trip from Cyprus \u2013 with much air-to-air tanking from those Voyagers that cost almost twice as much as the carriers did \u2013 before having to set off back to base pretty much immediately.\n\nIn any discussion of cost versus utility today, the \u00a36bn carriers and their F-35Bs (\u00a33+bn for the first 35) trump the \u00a334bn Typhoon and Voyager package absolutely hands down.\n\nThe final and most valid criticism of the carriers is that one of them is not in the Red Sea right now. It\u2019s being claimed by various people that this is happening for various reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a carrier ought to have a solid stores support ship, and the only one the navy has is unavailable. But the ship could resupply from US support vessels, or simply pop into Jeddah just up the coast.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that a carrier needs escort warships, and the navy is indeed short of these. Some people are claiming that sending a carrier to the Red Sea would mean the national nuclear deterrent would be dangerously exposed, or something.\n\nBut the fact is, the destroyer HMS Diamond and the frigates Richmond and Lancaster are out there anyway. We\u2019ve sent the escort group: we might as well send the carrier.\n\nMy defence sources tell me that the upper levels of the Royal Navy are very keen to get HMS Queen Elizabeth off the wall at Portsmouth and out into the fight: but they have been told not to.\n\nThe RAF is involved in this discussion too, as it has control of the partly-naval F-35B carrier fighter force. I would be very surprised if the RAF was not putting forward every reason it can think of why those planes and pilots can\u2019t be sent.\n\nUltimately, however, it\u2019s a political decision not to send a carrier. And in my opinion, a badly mistaken one.\n\nLewis Page is former Royal Navy officer\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments (34)",

                    "body": "Some time into his tenure as the defence secretary, Ben Wallace asked the Navy to think the unthinkable. Could they scrap one of Britain\u2019s precious aircraft carriers?\n\nTo understand what a shocking suggestion this was, we must go back to the late 1990s when HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales were conceived. It took three Labour governments; one coalition; two Tory governments; umpteen political about-turns; and a multiple of the original \u00a32.3 billion budget to transform the vessels from a job-creation scheme for bored shipbuilders on the Clyde to anything remotely seaworthy. The 25-year saga almost bankrupted the Navy and drove successive defence secretaries to despair. Now, amid the most serious challenge to freedom of navigation since the two ships were delivered, they are nowhere to be seen \u2013 raising serious questions about their utility in an age of modern warfare.\n\nOn the face of it, the crisis in the Red Sea is the perfect opportunity for the Navy to show that all the pain and woe for the ships they call \u201cour nation\u2019s spearhead\u201d was worth it. After all, the United States has sent one of its carriers to the region. Various fighter jets including the F/A-18 Super Hornet and E2 Hawkeye command and control aircraft have been zooming off USS Dwight D Eisenhower to teach Houthi militants a lesson. As Britain joins US air strikes against dozens of positions in Yemen, surely one of our great carriers is on its way to the action?\n\nSadly not. Both ships are currently keeping watch in that notorious trouble spot known as... Portsmouth Harbour. A few days ago, Tobias Ellwood, the Tory MP and former defence minister, asked the Defence Secretary whether he plans to task an aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The answer was no time soon, though according to the Ministry of Defence, our Carrier Strike Group (the collective term for the carriers and their support vessels) is ready to sally forth, should the call come.\n\nTo describe that as misleading is generous. For while it is true that the Navy could just about cobble together something resembling a Carrier Strike Group, despatching it anywhere remotely risky would be criminally foolhardy \u2013 and leave Britain dangerously exposed. The painful truth is that since the ships were first commissioned, the march of technology has threatened to render them both obsolete.\n\nWe do not have enough smaller warships or submarines or indeed weaponry to optimally protect them, in the way the US carrier is kept safe, unless we are willing to abandon the protection of our own coast and our nuclear deterrent.\n\nIn 1998, when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown approved the project, carriers were still the undisputed empresses of the sea. They had played a key role in the Falklands and would be critical to operations in Afghanistan. No piece of military hardware was more emblematic of hard power. Few countries can afford them, making them international status symbols. In the time it took to make them, the UAE built an entire booming metropolis: Dubai. No sooner were they ready, than they developed mechanical faults.\n\nMeanwhile our enemies have been busy developing \u201ccarrier killers\u201d. As a result, what the Navy optimistically calls \u201cour national spearhead\u201d is now vulnerable to a new generation of weapons such as China\u2019s Dongfeng-21D, a ballistic missile said to be able to close in on its target at 10 times the speed of sound. They are extremely difficult to intercept, and Beijing can make about 1,200 for the price of an aircraft carrier. Iran has similar stuff \u2013 so our carriers need to be kept hundreds of kilometres away from conflict zones. Unfortunately they are equipped with a take-off and landing system that limits aircraft range \u2013 rendering them somewhat useless in a situation such as we now have in the Red Sea. It is hard to avoid a sinking feeling that these two glorious vessels will never be much more than a ruinously expensive display piece.\n\nNo wonder Wallace, head in hands, commissioned a study into the viability of \u201cmothballing\u201d one of the pair. What he actually meant was getting rid of it altogether. Ashen-faced admirals then pretended they would be more expensive to scuttle than keep. Presumably Wallace couldn\u2019t face an almighty fight \u2013 or the national humiliation of scrapping a flagship.\n\nThe unprecedented threat to freedom of navigation all over the world shows that the Navy is more relevant to our national security and prosperity than ever.\n\nSadly, the absence of any realistic role for our two flagships in today\u2019s conflict suggests that our carriers are not. It is a bitter pill to swallow, but Wallace was probably right.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

                    "body": "By John Kruzel\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court this week is set to hear a bid by commercial fishermen to avoid costs associated with a government-run fish conservation program in a dispute that gives its conservative justices another chance to curb the regulatory powers of federal agencies.\n\nThe two cases being argued on Wednesday involve a challenge by fishing companies that argue that Congress did not authorize the National Marine Fisheries Service to establish an industry-funded program to monitor for overfishing of herring off New England's coast.\n\nMore broadly, the companies have asked the court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, to rein in or overturn a precedent established in 1984 that calls for judges to defer to federal agency interpretation of U.S. laws, a doctrine called \"Chevron deference.\"\n\nThe bid by the commercial fishermen, supported by a raft of conservative and corporate interest groups, is part of what has been called the \"war on the administrative state,\" a conservative effort to weaken the federal agency bureaucracy that interprets laws, crafts federal rules and implements executive action.\n\nThe Supreme Court in recent years has signaled skepticism toward expansive regulatory power, issuing rulings powered by its conservative justices to rein in what they viewed as governmental overreach by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies.\n\nSome legal scholars have said that if the court were to limit or eliminate Chevron deference, it would likely harm Democratic presidential administrations more than Republican ones. One reason is that Democrats tend to rely on federal agency rules to advance ambitious regulatory agenda items that Congress is typically unable or unwilling to pass.\n\n\"Chevron can help either party, but overall Democrats have more to lose than Republicans from its demise,\" said law professors Gregory Elinson of Northern Illinois University and Jonathan Gould of the University of California Berkeley Law School, who wrote in a 2022 law review article on the topic.\n\nCHEVRON UNDER FIRE\n\nThe fishing companies - led by New Jersey-based Loper Bright Enterprises and Rhode Island-based Relentless Inc - are appealing lower court rulings siding with the federal government. The conservation program overseen by the National Marine Fisheries Service was begun in 2020 under Republican former President Donald Trump and is being defended by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe regulation at issue called for certain fishermen to carry aboard their vessels U.S. government contractors and pay for their at-sea services while they monitored the catch. The New England herring fishing regulations were issued by the fisheries service, part of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nAmid concerns about overfishing and fishery management, the program aimed to monitor 50 percent of declared herring fishing trips in the regulated area, with program costs split between the federal government and the fishing industry. The monitors assess the amount and type of catch including species inadvertently caught.\n\nThe cost of paying for the monitoring services was an estimated $710 per day for 19 days a year, which could reduce a vessel's income by up to 20 percent, according to government figures.\n\nThe Biden administration said in court papers that the monitoring program was suspended for the fishing year starting in April 2023 due to insufficient federal funding.\n\nThe companies sued the government in 2020 in federal court, claiming the industry-funded monitoring program exceeded the agency's authority under existing law.\n\nThe administration has argued that the fisheries service program is authorized under a 1976 U.S. law called the Magnuson-Stevens Act to protect against overfishing in U.S. coastal waters.\n\nThe Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled in favor of the government. The courts found that the regulation was entitled to deference under the Supreme Court ruling, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that directed judges to defer to a federal agency's interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous.\n\nThe administration urged the justices to uphold the lower court rulings and preserve Chevron deference, saying among other things that the doctrine \"gives due weight to the expertise that agencies bring to bear\" and promotes national uniformity in the administration of federal law.\n\nAn attorney for the commercial fishermen said Chevron deference \"incentivizes a dynamic where Congress does far less than the Framers (of the U.S. Constitution) anticipated, and the executive branch is left to do far more by deciding controversial issues via regulatory fiat.\"\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\n View comments",

Jean Carroll.\n\nShe claimed Mr Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room nearly 30 years ago. The jury did not find Mr Trump liable for rape.\n\nMr Trump skipped the first trial, but arrived at the federal court in New York on Tuesday morning for the second defamation case that focuses on comments he made in 2019 accusing Ms Carroll, 80, of making up the allegations to sell books.\n\nHours before arriving at court, he risked a further defamation suit by suggesting that Ms Carroll\u2019s claims were \u201cpure fiction\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter a historic win in Iowa, I am going to the Biden encouraged Witch Hunt in Lower Manhattan to fight against a FAKE Case from a woman I have never met, seen, or touched (Celebrity Lines don\u2019t count!),\u201d Mr Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe claimed that the trial was a \u201ca giant Election Interference Scam\u201d, adding: \u201cI had no idea who this woman was. PURE FICTION!\u201d\n\nMs Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages in May from a previous lawsuit - STEPHANIE KEITH/GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA\n\nHis comments are likely to anger Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the case.\n\nJudge Kaplan said that this week\u2019s trial is not a \u201cdo over\u201d of the first and banned Mr Trump and his lawyers from claiming he did not sexually abuse Ms Carroll in front of the jury.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr Trump called Judge Kaplan a \u201cterrible, biased, irrationally angry Clinton-appointed judge\u201d and restated his assertion that he does not know Ms Carroll and has never met her before.\n\n\u201cThese are animals,\u201d Mr Trump said of the judges overseeing multiple civil claims and criminal cases against him.\n\nJudge Kaplan denied a request from Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers to postpone the trial for one week so he could attend the funeral of his mother-in-law, Amalija Knavs, in Florida on Thursday.\n\nBefore jurors were brought in, opposing teams of lawyers tussled over witnesses and Mr Trump\u2019s request for the trial to be suspended.\n\nAlina Habba, a lawyer for Mr Trump, told the court that it was \u201ccompletely unfair\u201d for her client to have to make a choice between his mother-in-law\u2019s funeral and fighting a multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit.\n\nJudge Kaplan said he was unwilling to suspend the trial, adding that it was up to the defendant to make a decision on which event to attend.\n\nThe judge did, however, offer to extend the trial by an extra day if Mr Trump, who is not obligated to attend court, chooses to testify.\n\nLawyers for Ms Carroll, who was awarded $5 million (\u00a33.9 million) following last year\u2019s trial, requested $10 million (\u00a37.9 million) in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages for a series of statements Mr Trump made denying her claims.\n\nMr Trump shook his head as one of Ms Carroll\u2019s lawyers told the court he used \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest microphone\u201d to destroy her client\u2019s reputation five years ago.\n\nLawyer Shawn Crowley said Mr Trump\u2019s defamation \u201chasn\u2019t stopped\u201d, adding that it was up to jurors to decide \u201chow much money it will take to stop Donald Trump from defaming her.\u201d\n\nMs Habba said Ms Carroll\u2019s career had \u201cprospered\u201d and that she is \u201cback in the limelight she always wanted\u201d, pointing to tens of thousands more followers on social media than she had prior to 2019.\n\nMs Habba said Ms Carroll had hired an agent and publicist, was now having a documentary made about her and collaborating on a book with Mary Trump, the former president\u2019s niece.\n\n\u201cShe has gained more fame and notoriety than she could have ever dreamed of,\u201d Ms Hanna said. \u201cNow she wants a windfall because some people said mean things about her.\u201d\n\nMs Carroll was \u201cfully enjoying the attention\u201d and was in a \u201ccocoon of love\u201d created by anti-Trumpers who stop her in the street to thank her, Ms Habba said.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

Jean Carroll, the writer whom a civil jury last year said he was responsible for sexually abusing in the 1990s.\n\nTrump was in the courtroom for jury selection but left before opening statements began to go to a campaign rally in New Hampshire. He was not present when Carroll attorney Shawn Crowley told the jury how Trump had upended her client's life and that they needed to return a verdict large enough to \"make him stop\" targeting her.\n\n\"We submit that number should be significant. Very significant,\" Crowley said.\n\nIn a post to his Truth Social platform hours after his projected victory in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, Trump called the case a \u201cgiant election interference scam.\u201d He added, \u201cI had no idea who this woman was.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s quick hop from a\u00a0victory speech on Monday night in Iowa to a courtroom in New York on Tuesday morning to a rally in New Hampshire Tuesday night is a microcosm of the former president\u2019s coming year, when he\u2019s expected to oscillate between campaigning and court cases, including four pending criminal trials.\n\nTrump, who is expected to attend Wednesday's proceedings as well, arrived in the courtroom at 9:40 a.m. ET, and took his seat at the defense table. Carroll was seated two rows in front of him and did not turn around. It's believed to be the first time the two have been in the same room in more than 25 years. During a break later in the day, Carroll walked out of the courtroom and passed by Trump, who had his back to her.\n\nTrump appeared attentive as U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan questioned potential jurors. At one point, the judge asked whether anyone in the pool of about 50 people believed that the 2020 election was stolen; after two people said yes, Trump looked over to see which ones. One of the two also answered affirmatively when asked whether they thought Trump was being treated unfairly by the court system.\n\nNeither was among the nine jurors eventually selected.\n\nThe judge has already found Trump liable for defaming Carroll in remarks he made as president in 2019 mocking her sexual assault claim. The jury\u2019s only task will be to decide how much money she should get for those remarks, as well as others Trump made after a different jury last year found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Tuesday morning as he was sitting in the courtroom, Trump blasted Carroll's account as \"fabricated lies and political shenanigans,\" and wrote that the judge has \"been unable to see clearly because of his absolute hatred of Donald J. Trump (ME!).\"\n\nE. Jean Carroll; Former President Donald Trump. (AFP; Getty Images)\n\nIn her opening statement, Crowley told the jury that Trump \"didn\u2019t just deny the assault\" when Carroll first came forward, \"he went much, much further. He said he had no idea of who she was. He accused her of lying and making up a story to make money and to advance some political conspiracy against him. And he threatened her. He said she should pay dearly for speaking out against him.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump was president when he made those statements and used the world\u2019s biggest megaphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her, and to destroy her reputation,\" Crowley said, telling the jury that Trump's verbal assaults had unleashed a flood of attacks against her from his supporters, threatening and insulting her. There hasn't been a day since where Carroll has \"not been afraid,\" Crowley said, adding that Trump's attacks have continued unabated since last year's verdict.\n\n\"He sat in this courthouse this morning. And while he was sitting there, he posted more defamatory statements, more lies about Ms. Carroll and this case. By our count, by our last count, 22 posts, just today. Think about that. Think about that when you consider how much money will it will take to get him to stop,\" she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to hold him accountable.\"\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba countered that Carroll's reputation has \"was not harmed. It\u2019s the opposite. She has gained more fame and more notoriety than she could ever have dreamed of.\"\n\nHabba told the jury that Carroll \"has been thrust back into the limelight like she always wanted\" and \"is looking for you to give her a windfall because some people on social media said mean things about her.\"\n\n\"She doesn\u2019t want to fix her reputation,\" Habba said. \"She likes her new brand and she has been monetizing it for years.\"\n\nTestimony is scheduled to begin Wednesday morning, with Carroll expected to be the first witness to take the stand.\n\nCarroll is seeking at least $10 million for the damage Trump caused to her reputation and most likely several times that amount in punitive damages for continuing to publicly call her account of his sexual abuse a \u201ccon job\u201d on TV and social media and at his rallies.\n\nTrump has said he plans to testify in his own defense. \u201cI\u2019m going to explain I don\u2019t know who the hell she is,\u201d he told reporters Thursday.\n\nIn a court filing Friday, Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan said Trump had already been found liable for the assault and, under an earlier order from the judge, could not relitigate the issue from the witness stand. She urged the judge to pre-emptively rein in Trump.\n\n\"If Mr. Trump appears at this trial, whether as a witness or otherwise, his recent statements and behavior strongly suggest that he will seek to sow chaos,\" her filing said. \"Indeed, he may well perceive a benefit in seeking to poison these proceedings, where the only question for the jury is how much more he will have to pay in damages for defaming Ms. Carroll.\"\n\n\"This Court should make clear from the outset that Mr. Trump is forbidden from engaging in such antics and will suffer consequences if he does so,\" she added.\n\nHabba argued in a filing Sunday that Kaplan's request was \"not appropriate\" and should be rejected. She said Trump plans to testify about his state of mind when he made his comments about Carroll and also plans to discuss\u00a0\"Ms. Carroll\u2019s continuous parade of interviews\" when she first went public.\n\nIn a ruling late Sunday, the judge said simply that the court \"will take such measures as it finds appropriate to avoid circumvention of its rulings and of the law.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys \u2014 who previously tried several times to delay the trial \u2014 had also asked in a separate court filing if the proceedings could be pushed back a week because of the funeral for Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs, on Thursday. The filing said Trump would be traveling with his family to Florida on Wednesday for the services and noted that the court is not in session on Fridays.\n\nKaplan denied the request but said Sunday that if Trump's team wraps up his defense on Thursday, he would allow Trump to return to court to testify next Monday.\n\nHe also noted that despite Trump's assertion that Wednesday is a family travel day, \"Mr. Trump has scheduled a campaign appearance at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, January 17, 2024 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\"\n\nHabba asked again Tuesday morning, before the jurors were called in, to postpone the trial so that Trump, who is under no obligation to be in court, wouldn't have to miss part of the trial while attending the funeral. Trump shook his head as Kaplan denied the request.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to last four days, is the second involving Carroll and Trump.\n\nIn a trial before the same judge last year, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, a magazine writer, in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s and for defaming her after he left the White House by calling her a \"wack job\" and her story a \"hoax,\" among other insults. The jury awarded her $5 million in damages, a verdict Trump is appealing.\n\nTrump had said he would testify in that case as well but he ultimately did not.\n\nCarroll\u2019s attorneys used \u2014 and according to court filings plan to use again \u2014 parts of the hourslong videotaped deposition Trump sat for in the case in October 2022 during the trial. In the deposition, Trump called Carroll\u2019s claims a \u201cbig fat hoax\u201d and \u201cpure fiction\u201d and insisted that \u201cphysically, she\u2019s not my type.\u201d\n\nDuring questioning, he was shown an old picture of him and Carroll standing together at an event and\u00a0mistook her\u00a0for his wife at that time, Marla Maples. \u201cThat\u2019s Marla. Yeah, that\u2019s my wife,\u201d he said. After the mistake was pointed out, he said the picture was \u201cvery blurry.\u201d\n\nTrump's lawyer in the appeal in that case, Joe Tacopina, told NBC News on Monday he had withdrawn from representing Trump in the case and also from his New York criminal case alleging that Trump falsified business records. Tacopina, a longtime high-profile New York lawyer, declined to comment further, which was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nCarroll went public in 2019 with her claim that Trump raped her. She was able to sue Trump over the rape allegation in 2022 after New York passed\u00a0a law\u00a0that opened a one-year window for adult victims of sexual offenses to file civil suits, even if the statute of limitations on their claims had expired, as it had for Carroll.\n\nThe jury didn\u2019t find Trump liable for rape as defined under New York criminal law but did find him liable for sexual abuse.\n\nAs a result of that verdict, Kaplan found Trump liable for defamation in this new case, which centers on the then-president's claim he had never met Carroll and assertions that she'd made up the story for publicity for her book and had been paid cash to concoct the story.\n\n\"It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations,\u201d Trump said in a statement on June 21, 2019.\n\nCarroll is seeking more money in this case than in the last, arguing Trump's remarks as president caused her more harm than the comments he made about her after his presidency.\n\nThe judge's liability finding greatly limits Trump's ability to defend the case, because he can\u2019t deny responsibility for the assault. In court filings in November, Trump's team said it plans to argue that Carroll \"did not sustain any reputational or economic harm as a result of the Statements\" and that if she did, any such harm was minimal. The judge told potential jurors that Trump's attorneys contend Carroll should receive \"nominal\" damages and no punitive damages.\n\nAs in the first trial, the judge will use an anonymous jury because of \u201cthe strong likelihood of unwanted media attention to the jurors, influence attempts, and/or harassment or worse by supporters of Mr. Trump [and/or by Mr. Trump himself].\u201d\n\nHe ordered that jurors\u2019 names, addresses and workplaces not be revealed and said the panel will be picked up from and dropped off at an undisclosed location each day.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\n\n View comments (233)",

                    "body": "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Wednesday that, on paper, are about a group of commercial fishermen who oppose a government fee that they consider unreasonable. But the lawyers who have helped to propel their case to the nation\u2019s highest court have a far more powerful backer: petrochemicals billionaire Charles Koch.\n\nThe case is one of the most consequential to come before the justices in years. A victory for the fishermen would do far more than push aside the monitoring fee, part of a system meant to prevent overfishing, that they objected to. It would very likely sharply limit the power of many federal agencies to regulate not only fisheries and the environment, but also health care, finance, telecommunications and other activities, legal experts say.\n\n\u201cIt might all sound very innocuous,\u201d said Jody Freeman, founder and director of the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program and a former Obama White House official. \u201cBut it\u2019s connected to a much larger agenda, which is essentially to disable and dismantle federal regulation.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nThe lawyers who represent the New Jersey-based fishermen, are working pro bono and belong to a public-interest law firm, Cause of Action, that discloses no donors and reports having no employees. However, court records show that the lawyers work for Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by Koch, the chair of Koch Industries and a champion of anti-regulatory causes.\n\nThe law firm\u2019s board of directors includes a top lawyer at the firm that has represented Koch Industries in a range of cases, like the company\u2019s past defense against lawsuits linked to its handling of petroleum coke, a byproduct of oil refining, and in its opposition to stronger regulations on the substance.\n\nThe lawyer also represents Koch Industries in an ongoing lawsuit filed by the Minnesota attorney general that accuses the company of deceptive practices related to climate change.\n\nOther members of the board include executives at groups predominantly funded by Koch or by Koch Industries, America\u2019s second-largest privately held company, after Cargill.\n\nRyan Mulvey, counsel for Cause of Action and one of the lawyers litigating the case before the Supreme Court, said the focus \u201cshould be on the fishermen and what they are fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is about the livelihoods of hardworking, family-run fishing companies that are under threat because of unconstitutional overreach by the government,\u201d Mulvey said.\n\nA spokesperson at Cause of Action said the group was within its constitutional rights to not disclose its donors. The spokesperson, who declined to be identified, said that Cause of Action and Americans for Prosperity were separate organizations. Neither Koch nor Koch Industries were involved in the case, she said. Koch Industries did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRolling back the power of the state to regulate business has been a long-standing goal of conservative legal activists and their funders, who have been engaged in a yearslong effort to use the judicial system to rewrite environmental law. In 2022, they scored a victory with a Supreme Court decision that could sharply limit the federal government\u2019s authority to reduce carbon dioxide from power plants. Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a primary cause of climate change.\n\nThe legal doctrine being challenged in the fishing case, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, No. 22-452, has wider implications. The doctrine, known as the Chevron deference, after a 1984 Supreme Court ruling involving the oil and gas giant, empowers federal agencies to interpret ambiguities in laws passed by Congress.\n\nCongress is not equipped to manage the day-to-day administration of the legislation it passes, the reasoning goes, so it should rely on federal agencies to carry out laws and policies. Weakening or eliminating the Chevron deference could limit the power of federal agencies to interpret the laws they administer.\n\nThe Biden administration has defended the rule, arguing that executive agencies, unlike courts, are politically accountable.\n\nSupporters of the rule say the case is a vehicle for other interests beyond the fishermen\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cThese fisheries workers are providing cover for what is ultimately a Koch campaign,\u201d said Lisa Graves, executive director of the progressive watchdog group True North Research and a former senior Justice Department official.\n\nWith the Supreme Court\u2019s shift to the right in recent years, free-market proponents appear to see an opportunity to clip the wings of federal power, in part by bringing carefully selected cases before sympathetic judges.\n\nThat shift has been aided by groups, including those linked to Koch, that worked to support the nomination and confirmation of the five most recent Republican appointees on the bench.\n\nAt a forum hosted in November by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, a lawyer laid out the strategy.\n\n\u201cTo successfully wage such a campaign, you need three things,\u201d Damien M. Schiff, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, said at the forum. \u201cMoney, legal personnel and a judiciary that\u2019s receptive to strategically selected and timed legal arguments.\u201d\n\nConservative groups and their backers now have all of those things, Schiff said, according to a video. In particular, \u201cmoney\u2019s never going to be a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can easily litigate to the Supreme Court on the cheap.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d responded David Doniger, a lawyer in attendance at the event who, 40 years ago, argued the original Chevron case on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cBut to me, this is clothing nakedly private interests in highfalutin\u2019 constitutional arguments.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Schiff said that cases like these were fast becoming the preferred way for groups to fight federal regulations. \u201cWhen you compare how much impact that one can have on society through litigating, and especially winning in the Supreme Court, to lobbying with administrative agencies or through political campaigns,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s much more efficient.\u201d\n\nHis group, Pacific Legal Foundation, is part of a network of conservative research organizations that has received funding from Koch and other donors.\n\nThe Loper Bright case, now consolidated with a similar case involving fishermen from Rhode Island, has in many ways offered litigators a compelling storyline of small businesses fighting for survival. The fishermen feature prominently on a page offering information on the case, promoted via Google ads.\n\n\u201cNobody in a family business wants to be the last one to do it, everyone wants to pass it along, and my fear is I might not be able to,\u201d Stefan Axelsson, introduced as a third-generation commercial fisherman, says in one featured video, titled \u201cFishermen fight back against unlawful, job-killing government mandate.\u201d Axelsson couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nThe page doesn't mention the Koch affiliations, though a contact form generates an email to Cause of Action, as well as to Stand Together, a nonprofit group founded by Koch, who remains one of its donors.\n\nThe Cause of Action Institute has disclosed little of its funding. A year before it was created, the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling had enabled billions of dollars in spending by groups that don\u2019t disclose their donors.\n\nCause of Action\u2019s founder, Daniel Z. Epstein, had previously been an associate at the Charles G. Koch Foundation. The group\u2019s first known address was the same as that for Americans for Prosperity.\n\nIn an interview, Epstein, who later served as counsel to Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign and transition team and is now an associate professor at St. Thomas University, said Cause of Action\u2019s work with fishermen hadn\u2019t been born of a motivation to overturn the Chevron doctrine. \u201cIt had everything to do with an observer program that spies on the fishermen,\u201d he said.\n\nHe declined to discuss funding.\n\nCause of Action has had two cash infusions, both from Koch\u2019s Stand Together, according to tax filings from Stand Together, including more than $4 million in 2019, and $1.1 million in 2020. In its most recent tax filing, covering the time when the fishermen\u2019s case was being worked on, the group reported having no employees. The case is being litigated by lawyers who work for Americans for Prosperity, including Mulvey.\n\nThe board that directs Cause of Action includes William Burck, who is the managing partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel, which has represented Koch Industries in litigation against environmental regulations. Burck is the lead lawyer in Koch Industries\u2019 defense in a separate case before the Supreme Court, the lawsuit filed by Minnesota accusing Koch and other oil and gas companies of undermining the public\u2019s understanding of the dangers of burning fossil fuels.\n\nOther board members include Emily Seidel, the chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, formerly director of special projects for Koch Companies Public Sector, Koch Industries\u2019 lobbying arm; and Kurt Level, the current deputy general counsel at Koch Companies Public Sector.\n\nc.2024 The New York Times Company\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "Broward, the state\u2019s second largest county, had a robust roll of active registered voters at the beginning of December: 1.28 million. By the start of 2024, the number suddenly had plunged \u2014 to 1.09 million.\n\nA few months earlier, records show, Palm Beach County saw a large downward bump as well.\n\nThe county went from 946,189 active registered voters at the end of September to 847,617 a month later.\n\nThe drop-offs in South Florida and elsewhere in the state have generated questions, concerns \u2014 and even a conspiracy theory \u2014 at the beginning of what already promises to be an enormously contentious election year in which people will decide on the presidency and, possibly, referendums on highly charged questions of recreational marijuana and abortion rights.\n\nStatewide, Florida had 13.5 million active registered voters on Nov. 30, the most recent data posted by the Florida Division of Elections \u2014 a decrease of 996,676 from 7.4% fewer than in Jan. 1, 2023. That\u2019s a decline of 7.4% even though the state\u2019s population is increasing.\n\nBy the time the full-year figures are collected, the drop will be well over 1 million because the statewide numbers don\u2019t yet reflect Broward\u2019s big December reduction.\n\nList maintenance\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? What seems like starting reductions is the latest manifestation of \u201clist maintenance\u201d conducted by county supervisor of elections offices.\n\nList maintenance is routine. But the Legislature enacted some changes last year, adding additional juice to the requirements and likely contributed to some eye-popping numbers.\n\nThe numbers mostly reflect people who haven\u2019t voted since before the 2020 presidential election. During list maintenance, they\u2019re moved to inactive status, something that ultimately can lead to a complete removal from the voter rolls.\n\nAffected are people who didn\u2019t vote in the last two general elections \u2014 either the Joe Biden-Donald Trump presidential contest in 2020 or the Charlie Crist-Ron DeSantis gubernatorial election in 2022.\n\nNot voting in either of those high-profile elections, \u201cto me, it\u2019s just an indicator that perhaps these folks have moved away or just aren\u2019t around any more or just aren\u2019t interested,\u201d said Broward Supervisor of Elections Joe Scott.\n\nHow it works\n\nScott and Alison Novoa, director of strategic initiatives at the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Office, said the elections offices send notifications to people who are registered but haven\u2019t voted in either of the last two general elections.\n\nThe big change under the newest law: Voters are warned they need to respond within 30 days. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019re moved to \u201cinactive status.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe person has to respond to the final notice or they become inactive,\u201d Scott said. \u201cEverybody who did not respond to that final notice ended up going inactive.\u201d\n\nUnder state law, \u201cThe supervisor must designate as inactive all voters who have been sent an address confirmation final notice and who have not returned the postage prepaid, preaddressed return form within 30 days or for which the final notice has been returned as undeliverable.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of notices get no response, Scott and Novoa said.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, for example, the list-maintenance certification certification the elections office staff completed when it finished the most recent round on Nov. 15 shows about 106,000 final address confirmation notices were mailed. Fewer than 4,500 voters responded.\n\nScott said the people being moved to inactive don\u2019t seem to be those who are truly interested in voting. A major indicator to him is that engaged voters respond in droves to notices that affect them.\n\nWhen his office sent a mailer to people who have voted by mail in the past alerting them that their requests had expired and they needed to sign up again, there was a flood of responses, he said. \u201cWhen we send out mailers to people who are active voters, they respond. When we sent out these final (list maintenance) notices, it was crickets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Inactive\u2019 can vote\n\nPeople who are on inactive status are still allowed to vote if they show up at the polls with identification or engage in another voting-related activity, such as requesting a vote-by-mail ballot. All of those activities involve the inactive voter \u201cconfirming his or her current address of legal residence.\u201d\n\nIf someone on inactive status does not vote in the next two general elections \u2014 for president in 2024 or for governor in 2026 \u2014 then they\u2019ll be removed. To vote after that, they\u2019d have to register all over again.\n\n\u201cYou need to do something to let us know that you\u2019re still here and that you intend to continue participating and continue voting. You will get re-active,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis group of folks will basically become ineligible if they do not participate in anything between now and December of 2026, that\u2019s when they will become ineligible. They\u2019ve got the \u201924 (election) cycle and the \u201926 cycle.\u201d\n\nA conspiracy concern\n\nPlacing hundreds of thousands of voters on inactive status alarms some people.\n\nAnd, according to the prominent fact-checking organization PolitiFact, a TikTok video advanced a conspiracy theory that Florida election officials had conspired to purge people \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 from the voter rolls.\n\nThe theory, debunked by PolitiFact, was that election officials were trying to prevent passage of a referendum that would enshrine abortion rights in the Florida Constitution. If the language of the ballot initiative advanced by abortion-rights proponents is approved by the Florida Supreme Court, the referendum will be on the November ballot.\n\nThe person who posted the video on TikTok \u2014 where a disproportionate share of young people get their information \u2014 framed the reduction as something sinister, declaring that \u201calmost a million people, mostly Democrats, have been kicked off the voter roll.\u201d\n\nEven though elections statewide are overseen by the Republican secretary of state appointed by DeSantis, list maintenance is conducted by the elections supervisors elected in each county but Miami-Dade. Scott in Broward and Wendy Sartory Link in Palm Beach County, the second and third most populous counties in the state, are both Democrats.\n\nDemocratic data analyst Matthew Isbell of MCI Maps said it isn\u2019t an issue. \u201cThe fact is that list maintenance happens all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the parties lose numbers in these list cleanups.\u201d\n\nPolitical implications\n\nIt isn\u2019t a partisan issue, but the numbers illustrate one of the Democratic Party\u2019s continuing problems attempting to stay relevant in a state that\u2019s becoming increasingly Republican.\n\nConsider the numbers:\n\nIn a Broward County Elections Office report dated Jan. 3, the county had:\n\n\u20141.09 million registered voters, down 13.7% since Jan. 3, 2023.\n\n\u2014505,547 registered Democrats, down 15.4%.\n\n\u2014245,997 registered Republicans, down 8.5%.\n\n\u2014316,318 no party affiliation/independent voters, down 15.8%.\n\nIn a Palm Beach County Elections Office report dated Jan. 2, the county had:\n\n\u2014854,728 registered voters, down 14.4% since Jan. 3, 2023.\n\n\u2014326,244 registered Democrats, down 16.9%.\n\n\u2014266,566 registered Republicans, down 8.4%.\n\n\u2014238,395 no party affiliation independents, down 18.7%.\n\nStatewide, the number of active Democrats decreased by 467,000 from Jan. 1 through Nov. 30, a reduction of 9.4%. The number of Republicans decreased by 153,000, a decrease of 2.9%. The number of NPA/independents decreased by 425,000, or 10.5%.\n\n(The numbers reflect the people who had been on the voter rolls, the people who have been moved to inactive or come off the rolls because of death or felony conviction and the addition of newly registered voters.)\n\nAs people move to inactive status, and ultimately off the rolls for whatever the reason, both parties need to register new voters.\n\nRepublicans have a finely honed, well-funded voter registration infrastructure. Democrats don\u2019t have as much money to invest in voter registration efforts, which makes it harder for them than for the Republicans to make up for the voters leaving the rolls.\n\nThat\u2019s compounded by other factors.\n\nMany of the previous generations of retirees that came from the northeast and populated the big South Florida condominium communities were dedicated Democratic voters. Many of the people moving to Florida now, either retirees moving to places like the Villages retirement megalopolis northwest of Orlando and south of Gainesville or younger voters attracted by the brand of conservatism that\u2019s flourishing in the state, means a better pool of newcomers for the Republicans and one that\u2019s less advantageous for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe only thing Democrats need to be worried about in this context is are you registering people to make up for that,\u201d said Isbell, the data analyst.\n\nCautious reaction\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tricky. It\u2019s good to do housekeeping,\u201d said Kate Renchin, co-chair of the Palm Beach County Voting Rights Coalition, which includes county chapters of the League of Women Voters, American Civil Liberties Union and National Council of Jewish Women. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be done every so often.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be fixed (by a voter moved to inactive status) but it is just another measure that makes it harder to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an ideal world we would advocate for same-day registration.\u201d\n\nChad Klitzman, a Democratic candidate for state Senate in Broward County who unsuccessfully sought the nomination to run for supervisor of elections in 2020, said the high number of people moved to inactive status deserves attention.\n\n\u201cList maintenance is a critical step in ensuring we have accurate voter rolls but this is an extremely large number of voters to have been removed. I hope everything was triple-checked and that we are doing everything we can under the confines of our laws to let folks know they have been deemed inactive before removing them from the rolls,\u201d Klitzman said via text message.\n\nOutreach\n\nRenchin advised people to occasionally check their voter-registration status at county supervisor of elections offices websites, though she acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s hard to get people to do. Everybody\u2019s running around so busy and they don\u2019t think about voting until the last minute.\u201d\n\nScott said he\u2019s constantly looking for ways to get voters engaged, so he\u2019s had his office cull the list of voters who were moved to inactive status to find subsets of people he thinks have a greater chance of actually participating in an election.\n\nThe first is people under age 30, who Scott said might have signed up during a campus voter registration drive. The second is people who voted somewhat recently, in either the 2016 presidential or 2018 gubernatorial election.\n\nEach group is about 25,000 people, with some overlap between the two. (Say, for example, someone who registered at age 20 to vote in the 2018 contest for governor but hasn\u2019t participated since.)\n\nLater this year, probably in the spring, Scott said he\u2019d send an additional mailer that bluntly tells people they are now inactive and will be removed from the rolls if they don\u2019t take action. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to be big and colorful\u201d to grab attention.\n\n_____\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley took third place in the Iowa Caucuses, ending the long, heated battle between her and rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nHaley garnered 19% of the votes and failed to clinch the second-place seat against DeSantis' 21%. Former President Donald Trump won with a distant 51%.\n\nWhile the caucuses may be over, Haley told her supporters Monday night that her fight for the White House isn't. Iowa has made the Republican presidential contest a \"two-person race,\" she said, alluding to her strong poll standings in New Hampshire, where DeSantis trails far behind her and Trump.\n\n\"Tonight I will be back in the great state of New Hampshire,\" Haley said, standing at the podium at the West Des Moines Marriott, a row of American flags draped behind her. \"And the question before Americans is now very clear: Do you want more of the same, or do you want a new generation?\"\n\nMore: Donald Trump cruises to early Iowa Caucuses victory despite spurning Iowa leaders\n\nHaley, whose remarks at the watch party were met with cheers, whistles and applause, reiterated a message she has often told Iowans on the campaign trail: A majority of Americans do not want to see a potential election rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nHaley supporters watch on as results from the Iowa Caucus roll in Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, at the West Des Moines Marriott.\n\n\"Trump and Biden are both about 80 years old. Trump and Biden put our country trillions of dollars deeper in debt, and our kids will never forgive them,\" she said, the crowd clapping in agreement. \"Both lack a vision for our country's future because both are consumed by the past \u2014 by investigations, by vendettas, by grievances. Americans deserve better.\"\n\nHaley said Americans deserve a focused president who cares about their needs, wants to rebuild the economy, close the border and stand up to the nation's enemies. They deserve a leader who \"will stop our self-loathing and division and fear and make America strong and proud.\"\n\n\"Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,\" she said.\n\nHaley headed into Caucus Day hoping the results at the end of the night would show the 2024 presidential race was a two-person contest between her and Donald Trump. As caucusing started Monday night, Haley made appearances at caucus sites in the Des Moines metro. Donald Trump Jr. also was at one location stumping for his father and the former president had just left the other when Haley showed up.\n\nHaley was the first major candidate to jump into the presidential race when she announced her campaign in February. The former South Carolina governor positioned herself as one of the top challengers to the former president, buoyed by her strong debate performances and foreign policy experience.\n\nDes Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll results showed Haley at 6% in August before rising to 16% in October and December. She reached 20% in January \u2014 second place behind Trump \u2014 just days before the caucuses.\n\nShe followed a slow, steady cadence of Iowa visits, holding 85 public events in the state throughout the campaign cycle. She largely stuck to town halls where she would speak about spending, immigration, foreign policy and veteran homelessness before taking questions from Iowans.\n\nHaley brought a polished and well-rehearsed style to the Iowa campaign trail. She rarely deviated from her planned stump speeches, walking onstage to the same guitar beat in \"Eye of the Tiger\" before urging her crowds to elect \"a new generational leader.\" She closed her events with Sheryl Crow's \"Woman in the White House,\" an emblematic reminder as she became the first prominent woman of color and the first Asian American woman\u00a0to seek the Republican nomination.\n\nFor most of the campaign, she rarely called out her rivals at her events. But she has stepped up her criticism of Trump and DeSantis in the race's final weeks.\n\n2024 Iowa Caucuses: Results by precinct\n\n\"I believe President Trump was the right president at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies, but rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him,\" she said in Waukee earlier this month. \"You know I'm right. Chaos follows him. And we have a country in disarray and a world on fire, and we go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. You don't defeat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos.\"\n\nWith voters, Haley has described herself as a \"scrappy\" leader \u2014 someone who is fierce and willing to stand up and fight for the American people. She often talks about running for governor of South Carolina after she was told to \"put away\" a bill she filed requiring legislators' votes be recorded whenever issues are debated on the floor of the House or Senate.\n\nThat bill, Haley has said, was among the first she signed into law after becoming governor. On the day of the bill signing, Haley says she marked the moment by blasting Pat Benatar's song \"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\" in the statehouse.\n\nThe 51-year-old is a daughter of Indian immigrants, a military wife, a mother of two adult children and a Clemson University graduate (\"Go Tigers!\" she tells Iowans on the campaign trail). She grew up in Bamberg, South Carolina, a town of a few thousand people where, she says, \"you couldn\u2019t think about doing something wrong without somebody telling your mom.\"\n\n\"No one's going to outwork me in this race. No one's going to outsmart me in this race. We have a country to save, and I'm determined,\" Haley told reporters in August after speaking at the Des Moines Register's Political Soapbox.\n\nNikki Haley leaned into differences with Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis on foreign policy and abortion\n\nHaley has staked out strong policy differences from Trump and DeSantis, notably on foreign policy and abortion.\n\nShe has leaned on her background as a former United Nations ambassador, walking audiences through lessons in geopolitical strategy involving Russia, China and Iran. She has often talked about how the United States must provide military equipment and ammunition to Ukraine and Israel, in addition to securing the U.S. southern border.\n\nAll three, she says, are necessary to protect national security.\n\n\"This is about preventing war,\" she said in Ankeny this month. \"It\u2019s always been about preventing war.\"\n\nHaley also has taken a less combative stance on abortion than several of the other candidates in the race, often telling crowds that \"the fellas\" don't know how to talk about the issue.\n\nHaley has said her rivals should \"be honest\" with Americans about the difficulty of winning over a majority of the House and 60 votes in the Senate to pass a federal law banning abortion.\n\n\"Everybody has a story. Let\u2019s be respectful of their story,\" she told a crowd in Atlantic in December. \"You will not hear me demonize this issue anymore, and frankly the fellas just don\u2019t know how to talk about it. We have to humanize this and treat it with the respect that it deserves.\"\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

The previous record was a 12-point win by Bob Dole in 1996.\n\nEmy Rivera, center, and Russell Van Horn check in to caucus Monday, Jan. 15, 2024 at Stutsman agricultural products in Hills, Iowa.\n\nDeSantis garnered 21 percent of the vote, with Haley not far behind in third at 19 percent.\n\nDesantis finished a clear third in Johnson County with 21 percent of the vote.\n\nPresidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy grabbed a comfortable fourth-place finish in the county, earning 7.2% and ending up clearly in fourth place. Ramaswamy will suspend his campaign and has already backed Trump, he announced to voters late Monday.\n\nRyan Binkley and Asa Hutchinson hovered around the 0.1% mark in Johnson County. Chris Christie was around the same mark, though he announced he would drop out last week. Two people in the county voted for other candidates not tracked by the state GOP.\n\nIowans participate in the caucus Monday, Jan. 15, 2024 at Stutsman agricultural products in Hills, Iowa.\nHaley nabs rare victory in eastern Iowa\n\nHaley\u2019s second-place finish was largely powered by voters in Iowa City, at the epicenter of the county, where she overwhelmingly picked up victories in the second precinct (50.8%), and the 23rd precinct (61.4%). Voters in Coralville also supported Haley, with 43.2% of voters in the second precinct backing her.\n\nHaley spent much of the summer and fall in third place in the NBC News/Des Moines Register Iowa poll and is projected to finish third on caucus night.\n\nIowa Caucus Replay: The biggest moments, the drama of the early race call and scenes around Iowa\n\nIowans participate in the caucus Monday, Jan. 15, 2024 at Stutsman agricultural products in Hills, Iowa.\nTrump carries Hills community\n\nHaley carried Johnson County despite garnering little support in one particular rural community.\n\nForced to brave still snow-covered, icy roads and frigid temperatures, turnout appeared to decline across the county from 2016, the last caucus that did not feature an incumbent.\n\nStill, nearly 75 voters turned out at the Republican caucuses in Hills, Iowa to help kick off the 2024 election season, showing resounding support for former president Trump.\n\nTrump pulled in 56% of caucusgoers inside Stutsman, an agricultural retail store, comfortably leading the way. Ron DeSantis finished nearly 40% behind Trump, with Haley on his heels. Ramaswamy picked up 11.3% of the vote to finish a close fourth.\n\nRyan Binkley nabbed a vote from one caucusgoer and finished fifth. Asa Hutchinson did not receive support from any of the 71 voters in the Hills, Liberty and Pleasant Valley precinct, roughly eight miles south of Iowa City.\n\nIowans participate in the caucus Monday, Jan. 15, 2024 at Stutsman agricultural products in Hills, Iowa.\nThe economy, safety key for voters in Hills\n\nLeon Van Horn, 67, has lived in Iowa for a half-century. He caucused for Trump on Monday night and said the economy was his top sticking point.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s so expensive,\u201d Van Horn said. He was raised by Democrats and even caucused for Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. But after the election of Barack Obama, who he called a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d for broken promises and subsequent economic shortcomings, he felt that Democrats were not doing enough to help keep dollars in his pockets.\n\n\u201cThings were so much better under Trump,\u201d Van Horn said. \u201cCost of oil, cost of gas\u2026 cost of living. Now, it\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nVan Horn said he doesn\u2019t mind Haley, who finished a distant third behind Trump in Hills but felt she is \"too soft on China.\"\n\nHe also wants a president more in control of the border \"like Trump.\" Under Biden, Van Horn claimed that 10.6 million illegal immigrants have crossed the border.\n\nThe most recent available data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection regarding full-year data shows that number is around 6 million between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2023, a period beginning in the fall of 2020 and running through September 2023. Apprehensions have been lower in Fiscal 2024 through November 2023 than in the past.\n\nCaucusgoers say the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of the meeting Monday, Jan. 15, 2024 at Stutsman agricultural products in Hills, Iowa.\n\nEmy Rivera, a native of Puerto Rico, has lived in Iowa for almost 35 years. She said she felt overwhelmingly \u201csecure\u201d when she first arrived in the United States. She never felt like she was in danger. Ever since Trump left office, she said it feels like she sees more arguments and more disagreements and generally feels less safe.\n\n\u201cI pray to god that Trump wins or another Republican,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI actually went to church this morning and I prayed.\u201d\n\nThe next step for Trump, Haley and DeSantis is the New Hampshire primary, which will be held Tuesday, Jan. 24.\n\nRyan Hansen covers local government and crime for the Press-Citizen.

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

Ron DeSantis changed course in a new interview by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \u201cwar criminal\u201d who needs to face consequences for his actions.\n\n\u201cI think he is a war criminal,\u201d DeSantis told Piers Morgan in an interview published Wednesday in the New York Post, adding: \u201cI do think that he should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nDeSantis argued that his earlier statement to Fox News host Tucker Carlson had been \u201cmischaracterized\u201d and that his \u201clarger point\u201d was that he doesn\u2019t think Russia can \u201ctake over Ukraine\u201d or \u201cthreaten NATO\u201d even if the U.S. doesn\u2019t escalate its involvement. He said he wasn\u2019t suggesting Russia\u2019s invasion was justified.\n\n\u201cI think they have the right to that territory,\u201d DeSantis said of Ukraine. \u201cIf I could snap my fingers, I\u2019d give it back to Ukraine 100%.\"\n\nIn the Post interview, DeSantis didn\u2019t take a position on the more complicated dispute within the GOP about whether the U.S. should send more military assistance or weapons to Ukraine.\n\nDeSantis, who hasn\u2019t announced his intentions yet, is widely expected to run for the Republican presidential nomination. Surveys show him to be the main alternative to former President Donald Trump, who is attempting a comeback in 2024. If he runs, DeSantis would be navigating a complicated GOP primary landscape, needing to win over a large share of Trump supporters, as well as the former president's skeptics, to capture the nomination.\n\nDeSantis said in a statement to Carlson published March 13: \u201cWhile the U.S. has many vital national interests \u2014 securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.\u201d\n\nHis previous comments had earned rebukes from numerous senior Republicans on Capitol Hill who support Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.\n\nFlorida Gov.

He was due in New Hampshire for a town hall late Tuesday on CNN.\n\n\u201cHaley, she was governor here for six years,\u201d DeSantis said at a campaign stop in Greenville, S.C., according to CBS News. \u201cCan you name major achievements under her tenure?\u201d\n\nHaley declared the Republican primary \u201ca two-person race\u201d in Iowa on Monday night.\n\nOn Tuesday, she said she would not participate in the next presidential debate in New Hampshire on Thursday with DeSantis unless Trump showed up as well. The former president has skipped all five previous GOP debates. ABC News canceled the event Tuesday evening.\n\nDeSantis lost to Trump in Iowa by nearly 30 percentage points and topped Haley by just 2.1 points. The second-place showing prompted the governor to proclaim his \u201cticket punched\u201d out of the state.\n\nBut DeSantis trails Haley by large margins in most recent polls in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Jan. 23.\n\nA CNN/University of New Hampshire survey last week showed Haley at 32% to Trump\u2019s 39%. DeSantis was in fifth place at 5%, behind former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom have dropped out of the race.\n\nAnother poll released Tuesday from the New Hampshire-based American Research Group had Trump and Haley tied at 40% in the state, with DeSantis languishing at 4%.\n\nDante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, said the DeSantis campaign has not made his state a priority.\n\n\u201cClearly, he\u2019s been focused solely on Iowa,\u201d Scala said. \u201cAnd when you turn on the television news here in New Hampshire, you see lots of Haley ads, Trump ads \u2026 but DeSantis is nowhere to be seen. And as a result, his support here has only dwindled.\u201d\n\nTrump wins big, DeSantis finishes a distant second in Iowa caucuses\n\nHis totals in Iowa helped dispel talk that he might drop out of the race this week if he came in a disappointing third. It could also help him somewhat heading into New Hampshire, Scala said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps he takes some of those quote, unquote, soft Trump voters,\u201d Scala said. \u201cMaybe he picks up some [Vivek] Ramaswamy voters. He might kind of nibble around the edges of Trump\u2019s support and give those soft Trump voters a reason to believe [in him].\u201d\n\nAny Iowa boost, Scala added, could also be short-lived as DeSantis\u2019 brand of culture wars doesn\u2019t play well in his state, Scala said.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire Republicans tend to be looking for different things than Iowa Republicans, and in particular, New Hampshire Republicans don\u2019t tend to like social conservatives, religious conservatives, culture warriors,\u201d Scala said. \u201cSo the Iowa bounce doesn\u2019t usually play out very well in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nIn Iowa on Monday night, Trump gave faint praise to his two main opponents after finishing with 51% of the vote, surpassing his goal of 50%.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate Ron and Nikki for having a good time together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re all having a good time together. And I think they both actually did very well. I really do.\u201d\n\nScala said he believes DeSantis\u2019 days as a presidential candidate are numbered.\n\n\u201cThe campaign death watch\u201d has started to tick, the New Hampshire professor said. \u201cWhatever he would do here won\u2019t stop that clock from ticking.\u201d\n\n View comments",

This is because northern Arctic winds are blowing into the area, Meteorologist Danielle Manning said. The winds will shift after the freeze, allowing the areas to shake off the chill, but by Friday evening, they are expected to return.\n\n\"The good news with the later week system is that we don't have any wintry precipitation with it,\" she said. \"Any sort of rain should happen when it's well above freezing.\"\n\nThe weekend temperatures are expected to be below freezing, 25 to 26 degrees, with the possibility of another hard freeze Friday night into Saturday morning.\n\nLafourche Parish Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness Chris Boudreaux said the parish has put down sand on the bridges and recently reopened bridges in the Gheens area, deeming them once again safe for use. Neither parish expects to close bridges tonight.\n\nBoudreaux said residents should keep their pipes covered for tonight's freeze and keep indoor faucets with a trickle of water to avoid pipes freezing.\n\n\"Tonight's going to be the coldest night,\" he said of the temperature. \"Maybe not as much wind, but tonight will be colder than last night.\"\n\nAccording to Louisiana State Police Public Information Officer Ross Brennan, bridge closures tonight in Terrebonne and Lafourche are not expected because there is no sign of rainfall. He said up-to-date announcements on closures can be seen either on www511la.org, or the Louisiana State Police's Twitter or Facebook page.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Courier: Terrebonne and Lafourche to freeze, officials urge caution\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "As widely expected, former President Donald Trump cruised to a 30-point victory in Monday\u2019s chilly Iowa caucuses, the opening salvo of the 2024 GOP nominating contest. The rout further cemented Trump\u2019s status as the most likely candidate to face off against President Biden in November\u2019s general election.\n\nThe Associated Press called Iowa for Trump at 8:32 p.m. EST \u2014 just half an hour after the caucuses began.\n\nYet Iowans also braved snowy, subzero conditions to weigh in on which of the former president\u2019s remaining Republican rivals \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or former South Carolina governor turned United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley \u2014 had earned the right to be the GOP\u2019s top Trump alternative going forward.\n\nThey delivered a split decision, awarding both DeSantis (about 21%) and Haley (about 19%) a fifth of the vote \u2014 and all but ensuring that the two candidates continue to divide the party\u2019s anti-Trump faction in future primary contests.\n\nAfter 11:00 p.m. EST, the AP determined that DeSantis had finished in second place, narrowly edging Haley.\n\nGood news for Trump\n\nTrump set sky-high expectations for his performance ahead of caucus night, urging volunteers Sunday in Des Moines to \u201csee if we can get to 50%\" support \u2014 a bar no GOP candidate has ever cleared. With more than 90% of precincts reporting, Trump appeared poised to make history with 51% of the vote.\n\nPreviously, the biggest GOP margin of victory in Iowa was Bob Dole's nearly 13-point landslide over Pat Robertson in 1988.\n\nDonald Trump at a caucus night party in Des Moines on Monday. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Trump\u2019s record-setting win that made Monday such a good night for the former president. Haley also helped Trump by failing to finish in second place \u2014 an outcome that could have forced DeSantis from the race, allowing her to consolidate support ahead of next week\u2019s New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Ron and Nikki for having a good time together,\" Trump said in his victory speech. \"We're all having a good time together and I think they both actually did very well.\"\n\nDid Haley miss her chance?\n\nOnce seen as the GOP\u2019s likeliest Trump slayer \u2014 he led the former president in national surveys for a brief spell in late 2022 and early 2023 \u2014 DeSantis lost altitude soon after launching his heavily hyped campaign last May.\n\nHe had long staked his comeback on a strong showing in the Hawkeye State, visiting all 99 counties, landing the coveted endorsements of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats and organizing his supporters to knock on nearly a million doors.\n\nYet Haley \u2014 who had been mired in fourth in the Iowa polls, with just 4% support \u2014 rocketed ahead of DeSantis in the state\u2019s final surveys after several solid debate performances.\n\nRon DeSantis at a campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, on Sunday. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nSeeking a knockout punch, Haley\u2019s campaign and her allied super-PAC combined to spend more on Iowa advertising over the last two weeks than any other candidate: a full $7.8 million compared to $6.1 million for DeSantis and just $3.5 million for Trump.\n\nFor DeSantis, even a narrow loss to Haley would have come as a devastating blow. In New Hampshire \u2014 which holds its primary next Tuesday, Jan. 23 \u2014 the Floridian (who averages 6% in the polls there) trails far behind both Haley (30%) and Trump (43%).\n\nInstead, squeaking out a second-place result will give DeSantis a reason to continue campaigning in New Hampshire and beyond.\n\nTo that end, DeSantis finance chair Roy Bailey said Monday that the campaign has \u201cplenty of fuel in the tank to get the job done ... into Super Tuesday\u201d \u2014 the big pileup of 15 GOP primaries on March 5 \u2014 assuming they \u201chave the success I think we can have in Iowa and exceed expectations.\u201d\n\nOnward to New Hampshire\n\nHaley remains the only candidate within striking distance of Trump in the Granite State, where the state\u2019s independent-minded electorate has gravitated toward her over DeSantis.\n\nHaley also averages double DeSantis\u2019s support \u2014 25% versus 12% \u2014 in her home state of South Carolina, which votes fourth on Feb. 24.\n\n\"At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running; I was at 2% in the polls,\" Haley said in her speech Monday night. \"The pundits will analyze the results from every angle. We get that. But when you look at how we're doing in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and beyond, I can safely say that Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race.\"\n\nExperts have long seen New Hampshire, which allows \u201cundeclared voters\u201d to cross over and participate in party primaries, as the best place for a Trump challenger to gain momentum. The fewer non-Trump candidates on the ballot, the thinking goes, the more support will accrue to the last man \u2014 or woman \u2014 standing.\n\nNikki Haley, center, greets supporters during a campaign event in Des Moines. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nSimilar logic led former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose New Hampshire poll numbers were about twice as high as DeSantis\u2019s, to end his campaign last week. \u201cI am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again,\u201d Christie said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s more important than my own personal ambition.\u201d\n\nBut DeSantis won't follow in Christie\u2019s footsteps after finishing ahead of Haley in Iowa.\n\n\"You helped us get a ticket punched out of the Hawkeye State,\" the Florida governor told supporters in his speech Monday night. \"We have a lot of work to do. But I can tell you this: As the next president of the United States, I am gonna get the job done for this country.\"\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s Trump who will emerge from Iowa in a stronger position than ever.\n\nWhy Iowa went for Trump\n\nDespite lower-than-usual turnout due to weather, an estimated 120,000 Iowans still showed up \u2014 and the lion\u2019s share caucused for a figure who faces four criminal trials on 91 felony charges ranging from election interference to hoarding classified documents.\n\nWhy? According to the AP's VoteCast survey, a full three-quarters of Iowa caucus-goers said the charges against Trump are political attempts to undermine him rather than legitimate attempts to investigate alleged crimes.\n\nNearly two-thirds (63%) of respondents to the National Election Pool entrance poll said that Trump would still be fit to serve as president if convicted of a crime \u2014 double the number who said the opposite (32%). And among white evangelicals, Trump\u2019s support \u2014 just 22% in 2016 \u2014 soared to 53% this time around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here in part out of spite,\u201d Marc Smiarowski, a 44-year-old public utility worker, told the AP at Trump's final pre-caucus rally Sunday in Indianola. \u201cI can\u2019t abandon him. [With] the political persecution he faces, I feel like I owe him this.\u201d\n\n View comments (39.3k)",

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden.

Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) received a science lesson on social media after she took a page out of the conservative winter playbook and conflated weather with climate change.\n\nAmid extreme winter weather across most of the U.S., Boebert on Sunday posted on X, formerly Twitter:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to appreciate the irony of climate protestors trudging through a foot of snow and -30 degree wind chills to yell about how the planet is warming.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t see it, do they?\u201d she added.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to appreciate the irony of climate protestors trudging through a foot of snow and -30 degree wind chills to yell about how the planet is warming.\n\nThey just don\u2019t see it, do they?\n\n\u2014 Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 15, 2024\n\nCritics mocked Boebert\u2019s incorrect understanding of climate change.\n\nAs NASA details on its website:\n\nSome people say \u201cweather is what you get\u201d and \u201cclimate is what you expect.\u201d In a nutshell, \u201cweather\u201d refers to the more local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours to days to weeks. Examples are familiar \u2013 rain, snow, clouds, winds, storms, heat waves and floods. \u201cClimate\u201d refers to longer-term averages (they may be regional or global), and can be thought of as the weather averaged over several seasons, years or decades. Climate change is harder for us to get a sense of because the timescales involved are much longer, and the impact of climate changes can be less immediate.\n\nCritics also spelled out the difference to Boebert:\n\nThe irony is your misunderstanding of global warming. It\u2019s not just about the Earth getting hotter; it\u2019s about extreme weather patterns as the Earth tries to adapt. This includes intensified cold spells, erratic rainfall, heavy snow, and more, all symptoms of climate change.\n\n\u2014 JJ El Boricua_\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 (@JJ_El_Boricua) January 15, 2024\n\nYeah @laurenboebert climate change is a hoax! pic.twitter.com/STcjDyeAQX\n\n\u2014 Quadcarl (@quadcarl_carl) January 15, 2024\n\nIt's called weather.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in second, with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley just behind in third.\n\nRamaswamy told supporters gathered at a Des Moines hotel that Trump \u201cwill have my full endorsement for the presidency.\"\n\nHe added: \"And I think we\u2019re going to do the right thing for this country. And so I\u2019m going to ask you to follow me in taking our America First movement to the next level.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his victory speech a few minutes earlier, said Ramaswamy \u201cdid a helluva job\" in the campaign. Ramaswamy said he would likely appear with Trump in New Hampshire Tuesday night and suggested DeSantis and Haley should \u201cfollow suit\" in withdrawing from the race.\n\nDuring the campaign, Ramaswamy needled most of his opponents but praised Trump as \u201cthe best president of the 21st century.\u201d He argued, though, that Republicans should opt for \u201cfresh legs\u201d while still supporting the America First agenda.\n\nThe approach, including his call for \u201crevolution,\u201d vaulted Ramaswamy into the mix of candidates vying to overtake Trump \u2014 or at least become a viable alternative. His decision to drop out, though, becomes the latest confirmation that the former president, even at 77 years old and under multiple criminal indictments, still dominates Republican politics and remains the overwhelming favorite to win the GOP nomination for the third consecutive time.\n\nRamaswamy\u2019s failure also affirms how difficult it is for any Republican other than Trump to push the bounds of party orthodoxy, as the first-time candidate found little political reward for positions such as his opposition to aid for Israel and Ukraine.\n\nRamaswamy said he would be open to vice presidential consideration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s going to be able to speak anyone\u2019s convictions but my own,\" he said. \"So if that\u2019s a role that I can perform from the vice presidency or any other one, I\u2019m going to evaluate whatever is best for the future of this country. But my No. 1 commitment is to truth.\u201d\n\nThe son of Indian immigrants, Ramaswamy entered politics at the highest level after making hundreds of millions of dollars at the intersection of hedge funds and pharmaceutical research, a career he charted and built while graduating from Harvard University and then Yale Law School. He brought to his campaign the same brash approach he used to coax money from investors even when the drugs he touted never made it to the market.\n\n\u201cDo you want somebody who grew up in this system who\u2019s going to deliver incremental reform? Or do you want somebody coming in from the outside?\u201d he said earlier in the campaign, framing his business success as a harbinger of what he could do in the Oval Office.\n\nIn a rapid-fire presentation on a range of issues, Ramaswamy wowed many GOP audiences by seamlessly mixing his biography and detailed policy positions with conservative talking points.\n\nHe advocated deporting the American-born children of immigrants who reside illegally in the country. He questioned the government\u2019s account of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and called for firing 75% of the federal workforce. He also called for raising the U.S. voting age. He hammered corporate America for its emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion. Ramaswamy called hawkish GOP rivals \u201cDick Cheney in 3-inch heels\u201d and laughed when one of them called him \u201cscum.\u201d But he always navigated Trump carefully, promising to pardon the former president for any federal crimes, including those related to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nYet alongside the bravado, Ramaswamy often ignored contradictory details, and his confidence sometimes brought him trouble.\n\nHe did not tell voters that he once described Trump\u2019s denial of his 2020 defeat as \u201cabhorrent\u201d or that he saw Jan. 6 as a \u201cdark day for democracy.\u201d He didn\u2019t say he invested in companies whose diversity, equity, and inclusion programs he calls \u201cwoke.\u201d His isolationist views and his assertions that U.S. politicians back Israel because of their personal financial interests drew the ire of influential conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity of Fox News.\n\nRamaswamy insisted he had a nobler purpose: \u201cI\u2019ll keep us out of World War III and then revive national pride in this country.\u201d\n\n View comments (1.6k)",

Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in an interview Monday that Dr. Anthony Fauci will not go down favorably in history over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the former presidential medical advisor should be behind bars for purportedly lying to Congress in previous hearings.\n\n\"His actions in covering up the origins of the virus will go down in history as probably one of the most egregious and infamous public health decisions in our lifetime,\" Paul told Fox News Digital in an interview Monday.\n\n\"Every step of the way, Fauci has publicly protested and said \u2018we never funded any gain function research in Wuhan,\u2019 but if you look at his private emails, it tells a different story,\" Paul said.\n\nGain-of-function research involves manipulating the genes of microorganisms to give them new functions or characteristics. In the context of COVID-19, gain-of-function research found that the virus could have originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, and involved experiments that enhanced its transmissibility, or pathogenicity.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, left, and Sen. Rand Paul\n\nDR FAUCI ADMITS SOCIAL DISTANCING WAS NOT SCIENCE BASED\n\nIn previous congressional testimony, Fauci refuted claims that the National Institutes of Health had financed gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab \u2014 the epicenter of the pandemic that originated in late 2019 and would soar to pandemic proportions in 2020.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFauci testified for the second time last week in private before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, which is investigating the origins of the virus.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, was reportedly perturbed that Fauci was unable to recall decisions or circumstances from the early stages of the outbreak, which claimed the lives of 1.1 million Americans, he wrote in a statement.\n\n\"Lying to Congress is a felony punishable up to five years in prison. When he came and told me that he did not find gain-of-function research and move on \u2014 that was a bald-faced lie. I gave him a chance to correct the record a month later when he came back to the committee, and he refused to do so,\" Paul said.\n\n\"And to this day, he has been dissembling and really trying to point blame away from him, but that's a felony,\" he said.\n\nCOVID-19 LOCKDOWNS: WHAT'S UP WITH NOSTALGIA FOR THE \u2018OUTBREAK ERA'?\n\nShana Alesi administers a second COVID-19 booster shot to Army veteran Robert Hall at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital on April 1, 2022, in Hines, Illinois.\n\nFauci also testified that the lab leak hypothesis \u2014 which was often suppressed \u2014 was not a conspiracy theory and that the policies and mandates he promoted may increase vaccine hesitancy in the future, Wenstrup wrote in a statement Wednesday.\n\nWenstrup said Fauci played semantics with the definition of a \"lab leak\" while acknowledging that a lab leak was possible.\n\nWenstrup said the admission came nearly four years after the publication of the \"Proximal Origin\" paper that attempted to vilify and disprove the lab leak hypothesis.\n\nFauci also denied allegations that he visited the CIA during the pandemic or influenced the CIA\u2019s investigation into the origins of COVID-19.\n\n\"Dr. Fauci\u2019s transcribed interview revealed systemic failures in our public health system and shed light on serious procedural concerns with our public health authority,\" wrote Wenstrup, a physician of over 30 years.\n\n\"It is clear that dissenting opinions were often not considered or suppressed completely. Should a future pandemic arise, America\u2019s response must be guided by scientific facts and conclusive data.\"\n\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED \u2018COLLECTIVE TRAUMA\u2019 AMONG US ADULTS, NEW POLL SAYS\n\nMembers of the World Health Organization team tasked with investigating the origins of the coronavirus disease arrive at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China.\n\nPaul, who is also an eye doctor, said the reason he \"continues to dwell\" on Fauci's handling of the pandemic is because he aims \"to pass legislation that creates an independent commission that will regulate gain-of-function research and try to prevent some of the more dangerous research from ever occurring.\"\n\n\"There was no science,\" Paul said of the COVID-19 guidelines like social distancing and quarantine. \"This was sort of medieval type of conclusions. And I think history will judge him harshly for doing this.\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Fauci for comment.\n\nFox News' Michael Dorgan contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Sen.

The number of caucusgoers comprised 15% of Iowa's roughly 752,200 registered Republicans. That falls short of the 20% to nearly 30% of Republicans who caucused in recent years, experts say.\n\nThe weather was a definite factor on the turnout, said Tim Hagle, a University of Iowa associate professor of political science, on Tuesday. Former President Trump's expected trouncing of competitors was another.\n\nAs caucusgoers gathered at 7 p.m. on Monday, temperatures had dipped to 4 degrees below zero in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, said Brooke Hagenhoff, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Johnston. The wind chill in Des Moines made it feel more like 21 to 24 degrees below zero, she said, while in Cedar Rapids, it felt like 24 to 28 degrees below zero.\n\nVoters walk into a caucus site on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, at Interstate-35 High School in Truro.\n\nDes Moines' temperature matched the Jan. 24, 1972, record low for a caucus in the capital city.\n\nHagenhoff said she's unable to say what time of day Des Moines hit its record lows in 1972, since no hourly data is available. And wind chill data wasn't reported five decades ago, she said. The Des Moines high was 25 degrees in 1972.\n\n\"It was an OK turnout,\" Hagle said. Despite the race generating a lot of interest, it \"wasn't particularly close. That's not overly surprising that turnout was down,\" he said.\n\n\"You probably had some people that were Trump supporters that said, 'He's going to win. It's too cold. I'm staying home,'\" Hagle said.\n\nPrecinct 14 caucusgoers wait to vote in the Iowa Caucuses at Ames Middle School on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, in Ames, Iowa. (Nirmalendu Majumdar/Ames Tribune-USA Today Network)\n\nIt was a historic Republican caucus win for Trump, who got 51% of the vote. Among the other top candidates, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis snagged 21% of the vote, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley won 19%. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who snagged 8% of the vote, dropped out of the race Monday night.\n\nThree other candidates \u2014 Texas businessman Ryan Binkley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 each garnered less than 1% of the vote. Christie suspended his campaign on Jan. 10, and Hutchinson dropped out the race Tuesday.\n\n\"Some people were suggesting that if it was below 100,000, that would look really bad,\" Hagle said, noting that critics balk at Iowa's first-in-the-nation GOP contest, given the state's 3.2 million residents and nearly 90% white population. Iowa Democrats lost their first-in-the-nation status late last year.\n\nWhile Trump wasn't technically the incumbent, Hagle said \"he's effectively running as the incumbent, and incumbents usually don't have serious challengers.\" Incumbents have \"very high name recognition\" and \"lots of support from their base from before when they won,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans set a record turnout in the 2016 caucuses when about 187,000 people participated, or about 29% of registered Republicans at the time. It was a hotly contested race between U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, then New York developer Trump, and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Cruz won the Iowa caucus.\n\nAbout 120,000 Iowa Republicans turned out in 2012 and in 2008 \u2014 about 20% of registered GOP voters.\n\n\"Historically, it was lower than average. But given the weather, it wasn't too bad,\" said Christopher Larimer, a University of Northern Iowa political science professor, of this year's contest.\n\nJeff Kaufmann, the Republican Party of Iowa chairman, said in a statement Monday night that caucusgoers braved the frigid temperatures, \u201cdriven by frustration\u201d with President Joe Biden's performance and excited by the GOP\u2019s \u201cdeep bench of talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIowans came out to have their voices heard,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cThey came out for their families, their communities, their state, and their country.\u201d\n\nA caucusgoer in Precinct 17 writes his preferred candidate's name on a paper ballot during the Iowa Caucuses at Ames Middle School on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, in Ames, Iowa.\n\nRepublicans make up about 34% of the state\u2019s 2.2 million registered voters.\n\nIowa's Republican party is trying to determine how many Iowans registered in person Monday at precinct sites to participate in the GOP caucus. One Des Moines location reported running out of forms to register new Republicans.\n\nWith President Joe Biden the presumptive nominee, Democrats met to discuss party business Monday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: Iowa Caucus turnout: 15% of state's registered Republicans show up\n\n View comments (1.5k)",

                    "body": "Everything\u2019s coming up Donald.\n\nWell, at least in the Republican presidential contests. Former President Donald Trump remains under four separate criminal indictments and is still broadly unpopular with the national electorate, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine the Iowa caucuses going better for him. Not only did he win by a record margin for a Republican, his two main competitors \u2015 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley \u2015 each took just enough of the vote to insist they were his main rival in New Hampshire, the next state to vote, ensuring the field will remain divided against him.\n\nTrump\u2019s win was sweeping and dominant. According to the entrance polls conducted by major media organizations, he won every demographic group imaginable: the college-educated and those without a degree; men and women; urban, suburban and rural voters; and evangelical Christians. The only groups he didn\u2019t win were moderates, who went with Haley, and voters ages 17 to 29, who backed DeSantis.\n\nTrump won 98 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, losing Johnson County, the home of the University of Iowa, by a single vote to Haley.\n\nOh, and Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur who competed with Trump for the votes of the very conspiratorial, dropped out of the race, likely handing most of this voters over to the former reality TV show star.\n\nNew Hampshire will be tougher terrain: Some polling there shows Haley within striking distance, and it is filled with the moderate, college-educated voters who are Trump\u2019s weak point. But Trump\u2019s challengers will get only so many chances to knock the de facto leader of the Republican Party off his pedestal, and they whiffed on a big one Monday night.\n\nHere are four other takeaways from the Iowa caucuses:\n\nA Bad Night For The Iowa Establishment\n\nDeSantis had banked much of his campaign on courting traditional Iowa power brokers. He won the endorsement of influential evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats. He also earned the endorsement of Gov. Kim Reynolds, and more than half of the Republicans in both the Iowa state Senate and state House lined up behind his campaign. DeSantis even made his defense of Reynolds from Trump\u2019s attacks a major theme of his television advertising. And all it got him was less than a quarter of the vote.\n\nThe result is a crisis for Iowa\u2019s political establishment, which has long built an identity \u2015 and careers and cash \u2015 around defending the caucuses and their importance to it. Democrats have already shunted the caucuses aside after Biden finished fifth in the state and won the nomination regardless. The state GOP, to which Trump will owe few favors, may have to worry about facing the same fate.\n\nNikki Loses By Degrees\n\nIowa entrance polls indicated a big education divide within the GOP electorate. Among voters without college degrees, Trump garnered 65%, DeSantis got 17% and Haley just 8%. College-educated voters in the Republican contest, meanwhile, split nearly down the middle between Trump and Haley (35% to 33%, respectively), with DeSantis getting 23%.\n\nThe polls show Trump\u2019s continued strength among blue-collar voters, long a mainstay of his political base, as well as college-educated conservatives who are weighing other options. But for Haley, the problem is acute. If she can\u2019t find a way to appeal to white working-class voters, especially in a state like New Hampshire, she may be in even deeper trouble.\n\nElectability? What Electability?\n\nIn 2020, Democrats in Iowa, and everywhere else in the country, were obsessed with finding a candidate who could defeat Trump in the general election. For whatever reason \u2015 Trump\u2019s election lies, a lack of shocking election losses in the history of the GOP, widespread belief in President Joe Biden\u2019s weaknesses \u2015 Republicans did not place nearly as much emphasis on, you know, winning the general election.\n\nOnly 14% of caucus-goers said an ability to defeat Biden was the top quality they were looking for in a candidate, compared with 41% who wanted a candidate who shared their values and 31% who wanted a candidate who fought for people like them. In 2020, when faced with a similar question, 61% of Democrats preferred a candidate who could beat Trump and 37% preferred a candidate who agreed with them on major issues.\n\nTurnout Dropped With The Temperature\n\nAbout 110,000 people turned out to vote in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, far short of the nearly 187,000 who participated in 2016, the last time there was a competitive contest on the Republican side. The cold weather and blizzard conditions, along with an NFL playoff game and the Emmys on television, likely contributed to the drop in participation, but Republicans have to wonder whether it signals a more troubling lack of enthusiasm for their presidential candidates in this election, especially if the trend is confirmed in future contests.\n\nIt\u2019s worth putting 110,000 voters into context: That\u2019s less than half the number who voted in last year\u2019s Philadelphia mayoral primary and less than one-fifth of the number who voted in last year\u2019s Chicago mayoral election.\n\nRelated...\n\nIowa Voters Go With The Coup-Attempting Candidate Accused Of Multiple Felonies\n\nOhio Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy Drops Bid For 2024 GOP Presidential Nomination\n\nWhat The Hell Happened To Ron DeSantis In Iowa?\n\n View comments",

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

The Orange County Digital Forensics Unit determined the location where the videos were taken using metadata.\n\nBefore resigning in June, Gordo was employed at an Orange County school that was not named in court documents.

                    "body": "With a frigid and anticlimactic Iowa caucus night behind them, the Republican presidential field moved Tuesday to New Hampshire, where Nikki Haley has her best \u2014 and perhaps only \u2014 chance to prove that Donald Trump can still be beaten in a GOP primary.\n\nThe shift means more than a change of scenery: For a brief moment, the spotlight will be on independent voters and non-Trump Republicans, who have only limited sway in most GOP primaries but are a force here, and may also play a major role in November's general election.\n\nThe prominence of moderates means three things for the GOP:\n\n\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations, has a decent chance of beating the former president in next Tuesday's primary.\n\n\n\nBut because New Hampshire differs so much from the Republican norm, Trump remains the overwhelming favorite to win almost everywhere else.\n\n\n\nAnd the alienation of moderates from the GOP remains a significant risk for Trump's chances in a general election against President Biden, despite the incumbent's current weak standing.\n\nRead more: Poll: California could be Trump's ace in nomination fight; he's way ahead\n\nOnly 10% of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's supporters and 22% of Haley's backers said they would vote for Trump in a general election matchup against the Democratic president, according to a Suffolk University survey of New Hampshire voters released before Christie dropped out of the race last week.\n\nThe general election threat to the GOP comes largely from voters like Christine Stover of Strafford, in eastern New Hampshire near the Maine state line, who went out on a recent snowy evening to join Christie's town hall at a barbecue restaurant in nearby Rochester \u2014 the last public event the candidate held before quitting.\n\nStover, a project manager at the local telephone company, said that until recently, she had split her votes between Republicans and Democrats. In the 2022 midterm election, she voted a straight Democratic ticket for the first time.\n\nShe shifted her vote because of the decision that year by the Republican-appointed justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the ruling that had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. for nearly half a century.\n\n\"At this point, I don\u2019t see myself ever actually voting for another Republican again\" for president, she said, although she was attracted enough by Christie to consider voting for him in the primary.\n\nHer husband, Paul Stover, who voted for Trump in 2016, said he was less certain of his choice this time around, but added: \"I really don\u2019t want to vote for Trump.\"\n\nLike many voters, he's put off thinking about the likelihood of another Trump-Biden showdown, hoping it might somehow be avoided.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit it: I haven\u2019t thought that far ahead,\" he said when asked what he would do if the rematch occurs.\n\n\"I\u2019ll think about it more when I have to,\" he added. \"That could be part denial.\"\n\nRead more: Schiff takes narrow lead in Senate race; tight contest for second, new poll shows\n\nModerate voters form a much larger bloc in the state than in most Republican primaries: Recent polls by Suffolk University of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire indicated, for example, that 41% of likely voters in New Hampshire's GOP primary define themselves as moderate or liberal, compared with 23% of likely caucusgoers in Iowa.\n\nBy contrast, evangelical Christians, the dominant force in the GOP in much of the country, made up only about a quarter of the vote in New Hampshire in 2016, according to exit polls, the last time Republicans had a nomination contest. Monday night in Iowa, evangelicals were 55% of the voters, according to the poll of caucus participants done by television networks.\n\nIn most of the rest of the country \u2014 including in Haley's home state of South Carolina, which holds its GOP primary on Feb. 24, and in California, which votes on March 5 \u2014the Republican electorate looks more like the voters in Iowa than those in New Hampshire.\n\nAlthough Haley is a southern conservative who has had strong evangelical backing in her career, she has become by default the candidate of northern moderates who want to defeat Trump. It's an alliance of convenience more than enthusiasm, but provides an outlet for a group that has increasingly been pushed to \u2014 or beyond \u2014 the margins of Republican politics.\n\nSeveral polls released last week showed Haley closing in on the lead here, with Trump holding about 4 in 10 likely voters and the former South Carolina governor supported by between a quarter and a third of them, depending on the survey.\n\nPolls and interviews with voters indicate that she'll probably pick up most of those who had backed Christie, which could give Haley most of the votes she would need to close the gap with Trump.\n\nNew Hampshire's postcard image is of rural towns built around churches with picturesque white steeples. In reality, the majority of the state's population lives in suburbs within hailing distance of the Boston metropolis.\n\nAnd while the state's voters are no longer representative of the Republican Party, they do roughly resemble a key nationwide voting bloc \u2014 the type of mostly white, middle-of-the-road suburbanites who have abandoned the GOP in droves in the Trump era and who played a major role in driving Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nJack Lagasse, an independent voter who attended the Christie event, said he expected to vote for Biden, despite worries about \"his age, and the fact that if he doesn\u2019t make it through the presidency, we\u2019ll end up with Kamala Harris as the president.\u201d\n\nBiden will be 82 and Trump 78 by inauguration day 2025, which falls on Haley's 53rd birthday.\n\nRead more: California-bashing is a constant occurrence on Iowa campaign trail\n\nLagasse said he would vote for the Democrat \"because of the vendetta that Trump has for everybody and the fact that he didn\u2019t want to give up the presidency the last time.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to try to turn this country into a dictatorship,\" he said, noting the argument that Trump's lawyers had made to an appeals court earlier that day that unless he was impeached first, he would be immune from prosecution for any crime he may have committed while president, even if he ordered the military to assassinate a political rival.\n\nWhile Trump's core supporters express fervent enthusiasm for his candidacy, other Republicans show a marked reluctance even when they say they expect they'll vote for him in the end.\n\nAsked what she would do if faced with a Trump-Biden matchup, Christina Austin, an executive assistant at an auto parts company in Dover, on New Hampshire's coast, gave a long sigh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not certain,\" she said.\n\n\"Biden\u2019s been very, very weak\" and is \"not doing a lot of good for the country,\" she said, but she added that Trump and his family have a lot of \"baggage.\"\n\nRead more: With her California dream broken, she found a political haven in Iowa\n\nThe moderate Republicans and independents who say they may vote for Biden aren't all new defectors from the GOP ranks. Many voted for Biden in 2020 and are drawn to this year's GOP primary largely as a chance to try to block Trump. But their continued disaffection is a reminder that even as Biden struggles with divisions in his party, Trump has alienated a significant share of what was once the Republican vote.\n\nIn Suffolk's New Hampshire poll, 7 in 10 Christie voters said they would back Biden in the event of a Trump-Biden race. And more than 4 in 10 Haley backers in Iowa would vote for Biden rather than Trump, a Des Moines Register/NBC News poll found.\n\nThe loss of such voters worries Ed Huminick, a real estate developer and local Republican official in his hometown of Salem, N.H., along the Massachusetts state line. A prominent Christie backer \u2014 and a potential convention delegate before the former New Jersey governor pulled out \u2014 he said he now plans to vote for Haley. But he is resigned to the likelihood that her efforts will be for naught.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I will hold my nose and vote Republican,\" he said, even if that means voting for Trump.\n\n\"I\u2019m 71 years old, and a Republican since I\u2019m 21 \u2014 50 years,\" he added. \"That's longer than Trump's been a Republican.\"\n\nBut, Huminick said, voters whose partisanship is not so ingrained won't do the same. New Hampshire, a closely divided state, has been slowly shifting toward the Democrats, especially in federal elections, and renominating Trump could create a tipping point for the state, he fears.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a Republican governor, a Republican state Senate and a Republican House,\" he said. \"I\u2019m concerned that \u2026 we\u2019ll have a Democratic governor, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House\" if Trump is the nominee.\n\nLike Paul Stover, many have simply decided not to decide for now, hoping that some combination of age, legal drama or mischance might avert a rematch they dread.\n\nWhen Christie pulled out of the race, he singled out for thanks one supporter, Toni Pappas, a Republican activist and chair of the board of commissioners for Hillsborough County, which includes Manchester, the state's largest city.\n\nAsked afterward whether she thought Trump was fit for office, Pappas said: \u201cNo, he is not.\u201d\n\nAsked what she would do if he were the party's nominee, she grimaced slightly before responding, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGet the best of the Los Angeles Times\u2019 politics coverage with the Essential Politics newsletter.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\n View comments",

Chuck Grassley, the oldest member of the U.S. Senate, has been hospitalized in the Washington area with an infection and is receiving antibiotic infusions, his office said Tuesday.\n\nGrassley, 90, will return to work \u201cas soon as possible following doctors' orders,\u201d his office said in a statement, and he is in good spirits. The statement did not give any additional details about his condition.\n\nThe Iowa Republican had hip surgery last year and briefly used a scooter to get around. But the eight-term senator, who was long known for his daily early morning runs, has appeared otherwise healthy in the halls of Congress even as he became the Senate's only nonagenarian in September.\n\nGrassley, currently the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, was first elected to the Senate in 1980. As the seniormost Republican, he was the president pro tempore of the Senate until 2021 when Democrats assumed control. The president pro tempore presides over the chamber, opens proceedings every day and is third in the line of presidential succession.\n\nGrassley\u2019s political career began in 1956, when he was elected to the state Legislature at age 23. He served 18 years at the Statehouse before being elected to the U.S. House in 1974.\n\nHe became the oldest senator last fall after the death of Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She was three months his senior.\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "Karen Moore vanished from her South Florida home on eve of her 53rd birthday. The nurse was set to pick up her 8-year-old daughter from Girl Scouts camp but didn't show after missing her shift earlier that day, June 27, 2001.\n\nShe and her white 1999 Saturn car were never seen again \u2013 until a year ago.\n\nSunshine State Sonar founder Mike Sullivan was scanning a pond tucked behind a strip mall in Davie, north of Miami, in January 2023. Footage from that day posted on YouTube shows a wheel slowly take shape on the sonar screen. Throwing a buoy down to mark the spot, Sullivan stays in the boat while YouTuber Britain Lockhart suits up and dives down to find Moore's white Saturn with human remains inside.\n\nIt may have been a major breakthrough in Moore's case, but finding a car wasn't surprising, really. Sullivan found more than 250 cars in Florida's many human-made canals, ponds and fountains in 2023.\n\nBy day, Sullivan owns an auto-parts ecommerce company. In his off time, he offers his diving skills, sonar equipment and team of volunteers to any local official willing to give him any morsel of a clue that could help him chip away at the otherwise-stagnant list of missing persons cold cases.\n\nIn doing so, he also provides answers for families who have not known the fates of their loved ones for years, sometimes decades.\n\n\"I'm happy to be able to have her home,\" said Christina Baber, Moore's daughter, in an interview with USA TODAY. \"I lost my mom 22 years ago, almost, and it's a day I never thought would happen.\"\n\nChristina Baber and her mother Karen Moore, who went missing in 2001. Baber remembers her mother taking her out on fun adventures frequently.\n1,735 missing people in Florida's 7,500 lakes and 76,000 stormwater ponds\n\nFlorida is covered in water. In addition to the 7,500 lakes and 12,000 miles of waterways, a 2020 survey cited by the University of Florida found 76,000 artificial ponds for stormwater drainage\u00a0in the state.\n\nThat means there are lots of places to look for clues for Florida's 1,735 missing persons cases.\n\nSullivan sifts through databases like the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), The Charley Project and Map the Missing, filtering out those who vanished with their car.\n\nHe has help sorting through the thousands of ponds where these cars could be hiding, the equivalent of Spider-Man's \"guy in the chair.\" Her name is Shelly Ranae, and from her post in Virginia, she pores over satellite maps year by year, looking for bodies of water on routes the missing could have taken that have remained filled since the person was last seen.\n\nThese aren't always obvious. Many ponds for storm drainage in Florida are more like glorified puddles, dotting major roadways and new housing developments. Sunshine State Sonar found Sandra Lemire's car, missing since 2012, under 14 feet of water that collected in the corner of a highway onramp near Disney World.\n\nOnce they get a hit for a car on his radar, Sullivan or one of the other volunteer divers he occasionally collaborates with suits up. They brave waters with sewage, litter and sometimes alligators to crawl the dirty depths in search of someone's loved one. He said he has located nearly a dozen bodies in submerged cars since he started in July 2021, and it is always those final moments before discovery that are most intense.\n\n\"My stress level was through the roof\" before he dived and found Lemire's car, Sullivan told USA TODAY. \"I had to sit down, catch my breath and just calm myself down before I got in that water. ... But you have to do it ... like this is the end, we have to find out if this is her car or it's belonging to another case.\"\n\nVan pulled from a pond on the highway near Disney, outside of Orlando. Officials with the Orlando Police Department, the Osceola Sheriff's Office and the Orange County Sheriff's Office assisted with the recovery.\nMiami-Dade waters hold dozens of stolen cars turned into 'artificial reef'\nTag pull off of car found in Miami canal. The car belonged to Maureen Therese Sherman, who went missing on May 1, 1985. It was discovered by Sunshine State Sonar on Friday, Jan. 5, 2024.\n\nIn the first week of 2024, Sunshine State Sonar located two cars with human remains. One appeared to have skeletonized remains of three people, Sullivan said, but authorities had confirmed only one human body as of Thursday. The other car belonged to a missing person, Maureen Therese Sherman, and authorities were testing the remains to see whether they are hers.\n\nSullivan was on one of his expeditions to the Miami-Dade area, where he estimates 1,000 cars are hiding below waters. (A spokesperson with the Miami-Dade Police Department told USA TODAY there is no way to know exactly how many submerged cars there are in the county but said 1,000 was possible.)\n\nMany of the cars are clearly stolen, Sullivan said, given away by a brick tied to the gas pedal or a plank rigged to the steering wheel to send it into the pond without a driver. He said authorities instruct him to leave those cars alone, sparing the department's resources in favor of letting them become \"artificial reefs.\"\n\nSometimes he has to sort through dozens of such cars to find one linked to a case. He said the canal where he found Sherman, missing since 1985 from her home nearby, had 24 cars in it.\n\nWhile diving another canal in the area the same weekend, Sullivan said the team stopped counting at 17 cars. Other nearby \"honey holes,\" as he calls them, can hold 30 cars or more.\n\nEven if a car he finds doesn't match a missing person profile Sullivan has in mind, he still tries to peek inside to see if there is evidence of a body. When he found a 1983 Oldsmobile in a mall pond, he shook the sediment that settled in the backseat, sending a shoe still attached to leg bones floating to the surface.\n\nSullivan said he wants to start branching out, scanning more retention ponds on the sides of the highway where people may have never thought to look.\n\nOccasionally, people tell Sullivan not to look for their missing relative, hoping to avoid grieving them a second time if he finds their body. But he perseveres with the case anyway, believing that some loved one could still want answers.\n\n\"I feel kind of obligated to do this for (families). ... I know if I don't do it, then they will never know because nobody else will do it,\" Sullivan said. \"It's up to me; it's up to our team. If we can't do this, that family's never going to get answers. And we carry that on our shoulders.\"\n\nAn Oldsmobile containing human remains pulled from a mall pond in Florida. Sunrise police said the car was last registered in 2005.\nBaber held memorial service for found mother: 'Thank you for bringing closure to another family'\nKaren Moore, who was reported missing on her 53rd birthday. She is survived by her daughter, who said Moore \"always cared for others and put others 1st.\"\n\nBaber said her mother's neighbor was the last to see her leaving her house the day before she didn't show up for work.\n\nMoore was divorcing Baber's father when she vanished, and Baber said it was out of character for her not to show up for their scheduled visitation time.\n\n\"Everything was centered around my childhood happiness,\" Baber said of her mother, remembering their frequent visits to the children's museum and the zoo. \"I lost that rather quickly once she went missing.\"\n\nDetective Eddy Velazquez from the Davie Police Department said the investigation into Moore's case is still open. He confirmed the remains in the car belonged to her and said her death has not been ruled a homicide.\n\nBaber said she has never stopped trying to find answers about her mother \u2013 where she was going that night, whom she was in touch with, and how her car ended up in a pond far back from the roadway.\n\nBut with her mother's body found, Baber was able to hold a memorial service, with family flying in from as far as Alaska, she said. Baber's twin daughters, Eliza and Olivia, look at the picture of Moore next to her urn in Baber's home in Indiana, hearing stories about the grandmother they never met.\n\n\"I'm so thankful to finally have closure and have her home. It's still surreal at the same time. I mean, my whole life has been wondering what happened to my mom,\" she said.\n\nBaber keeps in touch with Sullivan regularly, following his searches and discoveries.\n\n\"Any time he has found anybody ... I send him a text saying 'Thank you for bringing closure to another family,'\" she said, pausing as her voice trembled with emotion. \"They don't have to go out and do what they're doing. And they are. It's such a wonderful thing.\"\n\nMike Sullivan (left), Christina Baber (middle) and Ken Fleming. Sullivan found the car and recovered Karen Moore's remains with the help of Fleming.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sunshine State Sonar divers look for sunken cars, missing people\n\n View comments (274)",

                    "body": "Congress is racing to fund the government by Friday\u2019s partial shutdown deadline, a heavy task that is bound to get weightier as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) navigates growing anger in his conference over his handling of spending matters.\n\nThe mad dash comes after congressional leaders rolled out a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown over the weekend, settling on another two-set stopgap bill that would keep the government funded into March. The Senate is scheduled to hold the first procedural vote for the legislation late Tuesday.\n\nHouse conservatives, however, are already coming out against the move, a reality that is sure to worsen headaches for Johnson as he works to keep the lights on in Washington before midnight Friday while also managing his warring conference.\n\nAlso this week, the House is set \u2014\u00a0for now \u2014 to vote on a resolution to hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress after President Biden\u2019s son defied a congressional subpoena last month, though the punishment could be pulled from the schedule if the younger Biden\u2019s team reaches an agreement with House Republicans to testify during a closed-door deposition.\n\nAnd the second of four impeachment hearings focused on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is slated for this week, as the House GOP conference barrels toward trying to oust the embattled secretary.\n\nCongress stares down government funding deadline\n\nThe Senate is scheduled to hold a procedural vote on the continuing resolution (CR) proposal Tuesday afternoon at around 5:45 p.m., officially kicking off the process to avert a shutdown by Friday\u2019s midnight deadline.\n\nThe vote comes after congressional leaders\u00a0announced a two-part CR Sunday, unveiling another version of the unconventional stopgap bill to avert a shutdown.\n\nThe legislation would extend funding for programs at the departments of Agriculture; Energy; Veterans Affairs; Transportation; and Housing and Urban Development through March 1, and the rest of the government until March 8.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) acknowledged the quick pace that Congress has to consider and approve the stopgap to avert a shutdown, underscoring the need for bipartisan action.\n\n\u201cTo avoid a shutdown, it will take bipartisan cooperation in the Senate and the House to quickly pass the CR and send it to the President\u2019s desk before Friday\u2019s funding deadline,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.\n\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) addresses reporters following the weekly policy luncheon on Tuesday, January 9, 2024.\n\nThat bipartisan cooperation, however, is expected to be far from unanimous in the House, where conservatives are already voicing their opposition to the stopgap bill, even though it uses the same two-part framework many of them backed during the previous shutdown threat in November in an effort to avoid a massive end-of-year, whole-of-government omnibus funding bill.\n\nHard-liners traditionally oppose CRs because they do not cut spending from the previous year, and many in the right flank are now demanding border security be included in the government funding fight, which is not the case with the proposed stopgap bill.\n\n\u201cThe @HouseGOP is planning to pass a short-term spending bill continuing Pelosi levels with Biden policies, to buy time to pass longer-term spending bills at Pelosi levels with Biden policies. This is what surrender looks like,\u201d the House Freedom Caucus\u00a0wrote on social media, referring to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a former chair of the conservative group,\u00a0wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter:\u00a0\u201cEnough with the continuing resolutions,\u201d later adding \u201cWe are doing the American people a disservice.\u201d\n\nThat conservative opposition will mean that Johnson will likely have to bring the stopgap bill to the floor under suspension of the rules, a fast-track process that bypasses first approving a rule.\n\nMore top stories from The Hill:\n\nHouse, Senate tax chiefs announce deal on business deductions, low-income credits\n\nSupreme Court won\u2019t review school transgender bathroom policies\n\nWinners and losers of the Iowa caucuses\n\nRule votes are typically routine procedures, where the majority party votes in support and the minority party votes in opposition, but conservatives have voted against the procedural vote \u2014\u00a0and therefore shut down legislative business \u2014\u00a0several times this Congress to showcase their opposition to leadership decisions.\n\nBut when operating under suspension of the rules, legislation requires two-thirds support for passage \u2014\u00a0meaning the stopgap bill will require heavy support from Democrats, a reality that is sure to incense House conservatives even more, as it has in the past.\n\nEight House Republicans voted with Democrats in October to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) after he worked with Democrats to avert a shutdown, and hard-liners criticized Johnson in November after he did the same.\n\nIf Congress gets the stopgap proposal over the finish line by Friday, it will mark the third CR Congress has had to pass since fiscal 2024 began at the end of September.\n\nJohnson\u2019s backing of the CR, to be sure, did mark something of a reversal for him. In November, the newly minted Speaker said \u201cI\u2019m done with short-term CRs,\u201d but he is backing one now, as it becomes clear that lawmakers need more time to complete the appropriations process.\n\nCongressional leaders reached a deal on top-line spending numbers earlier this month, but lawmakers need more time to hash out particulars in the 12 spending bills.\n\nHunter Biden contempt of Congress vote hangs in limbo\n\nThe House is scheduled to vote on holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress on Thursday \u2014\u00a0but the vote could be yanked if the president\u2019s son strikes a deal with Republicans to testify.\n\nThe chance of canceling the vote comes after days of public back-and-forth between Hunter Biden\u2019s team and House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), which has led to a potential agreement between the two sides.\n\nLast week, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, told the committees in a letter that his client would be\u00a0willing to sit for a closed-door deposition\u00a0if the panels reissued subpoenas requesting his testimony, a shift from their previous position that Biden would only participate in a public hearing. His legal team had been concerned that GOP lawmakers would selectively leak and misconstrue Biden\u2019s remarks following a closed-door deposition and instead offered to testify publicly.\n\nIn his letter, Lowell argued that the previous subpoenas were invalid because they were issued before House Republicans voted to solidify its impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Jordan and Comer, however, rebuffed the request, writing in a statement: \u201cFor now, the House of Representatives will move forward with holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress until such time that Hunter Biden confirms a date to appear for a private deposition in accordance with his legal obligation.\u201d\n\nBut Sunday, the GOP chairs informed Lowell in a letter\u00a0that they were willing to reissue the subpoenas in hopes of getting Hunter Biden to answer questions.\n\n\u201cThe Committees welcome Mr. Biden\u2019s newfound willingness to testify in a deposition setting under subpoena. Although the Committee\u2019s subpoenas are lawful and remain legally enforceable, as an accommodation to Mr. Biden and your request, we are prepared to issue subpoenas compelling Mr. Biden\u2019s appearance at a deposition on a new date in the coming weeks,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHunter Biden\n\nHunter Biden is seen as his lawyer Abbe Lowell makes a statement to reporters outside a House Oversight Committee markup on Wednesday, January 10, 2024 as they consider a resolution to hold Biden in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena last month.\n\nA spokesperson for Jordan told The Hill on Monday that the panels are ready to pull Thursday\u2019s contempt of Congress vote if the two parties can set a date for a deposition.\n\n\u201cIf they agree to genuinely cooperate and we can work out a deposition date, the Chairman will recommend to Leadership that we hold the floor vote on contempt in abeyance for now,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nHouse Republicans are seeking to hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress after he\u00a0defied a congressional subpoena\u00a0last month, failing to sit for a closed-door deposition as part of the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president. Instead, the younger Biden delivered a public statement on the Capitol complex in which he said \u201cmy father was not financially involved in my business.\u201d\n\nThe Oversight and Judiciary committees\u00a0advanced resolutions to hold Biden in contempt of Congress last week, sending them to the full House for consideration.\n\nIf the House approves the contempt of Congress resolution, the Justice Department would then decide whether to bring charges against Hunter Biden. The resolution solely serves as a recommendation.\n\nHunter Biden also visited Capitol Hill last week, making a surprise appearance\u00a0at the Oversight Committee markup of the resolution to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nMayorkas impeachment hearing No. 2\n\nHouse Republicans are set to hold another impeachment hearing for Mayorkas this week, marking the second of four planned presentations as GOP lawmakers ramp up their efforts to oust the Cabinet secretary.\n\nThe\u00a0hearing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0scheduled for Thursday at 9:30 a.m. \u2014\u00a0is titled \u201cVoices for the Victims: The Heartbreaking Reality of the Mayorkas Border Crisis.\u201d According to Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, the hearing will feature testimony from witnesses who \u201chave been impacted by Secretary Mayorkas\u2019 refusal to enforce the laws passed by Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe human cost of Secretary Mayorkas\u2019 failed leadership and decision-making is truly immeasurable,\u201d Green wrote in a\u00a0statement last week. \u201cDue to his refusal to uphold his oath of office, tens of thousands of families have suffered the devasting (sic) loss of loved ones due to the smuggling of fentanyl across our open Southwest border, law enforcement at our borders and across the country have been completely overwhelmed, and countless Americans and migrants have lost their lives at the hands of vicious cartels and gang members.\u201d\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas testifies during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on threats to the homeland, Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing will follow\u00a0last week\u2019s presentation, during which GOP lawmakers argued that Mayorkas was at the center of the influx of migrants at the border. Green called the secretary \u201cthe architect of the devastation that we have witnessed for nearly three years,\u201d and re-upped his claim that Mayorkas was demonstrating \u201ca willful violation of his oath of office.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, countered that argument, contending that Mayorkas was not behind any impeachable offenses. Instead, Democrats claimed, Republicans were targeting Mayorkas because they disagree with the Biden administration\u2019s policies.\n\nHouse Republicans are staging the series of hearings in a lead-up to a markup of a resolution that formally calls for impeaching Mayorkas. The effort follows a months-long review of Mayorkas\u2019s leadership that Green spearheaded.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n\n View comments",

He doth protest way too much. An innocent person doesn't have the need for this kind of theatrics and hysterics \u2014 a guilty person, not so much.\n\nOn a scale of one to ten, this show gets a one.

Can you imagine if that had been true all these years?\n\nIf a president needs total immunity to do their job, they should not be president. Every elected official needs to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nEven if the 90-plus other criminal charges against Trump are tossed out, him trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power is more than enough to disqualify him from office. We cannot allow this man a free pass for his actions.\n\nIf Trump or any other president is given immunity, it would create a cataclysmic breakdown of one of the fundamental pillars of our democracy.\n\nRon Diton, Upland\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "With a frigid and anticlimactic Iowa caucus night behind them, the Republican presidential field moved Tuesday to New Hampshire, where Nikki Haley has her best \u2014 and perhaps only \u2014 chance to prove that Donald Trump can still be beaten in a GOP primary.\n\nThe shift means more than a change of scenery: For a brief moment, the spotlight will be on independent voters and non-Trump Republicans, who have only limited sway in most GOP primaries but are a force here, and may also play a major role in November's general election.\n\nThe prominence of moderates means three things for the GOP:\n\n\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations, has a decent chance of beating the former president in next Tuesday's primary.\n\n\n\nBut because New Hampshire differs so much from the Republican norm, Trump remains the overwhelming favorite to win almost everywhere else.\n\n\n\nAnd the alienation of moderates from the GOP remains a significant risk for Trump's chances in a general election against President Biden, despite the incumbent's current weak standing.\n\nRead more: Poll: California could be Trump's ace in nomination fight; he's way ahead\n\nOnly 10% of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's supporters and 22% of Haley's backers said they would vote for Trump in a general election matchup against the Democratic president, according to a Suffolk University survey of New Hampshire voters released before Christie dropped out of the race last week.\n\nThe general election threat to the GOP comes largely from voters like Christine Stover of Strafford, in eastern New Hampshire near the Maine state line, who went out on a recent snowy evening to join Christie's town hall at a barbecue restaurant in nearby Rochester \u2014 the last public event the candidate held before quitting.\n\nStover, a project manager at the local telephone company, said that until recently, she had split her votes between Republicans and Democrats. In the 2022 midterm election, she voted a straight Democratic ticket for the first time.\n\nShe shifted her vote because of the decision that year by the Republican-appointed justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the ruling that had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. for nearly half a century.\n\n\"At this point, I don\u2019t see myself ever actually voting for another Republican again\" for president, she said, although she was attracted enough by Christie to consider voting for him in the primary.\n\nHer husband, Paul Stover, who voted for Trump in 2016, said he was less certain of his choice this time around, but added: \"I really don\u2019t want to vote for Trump.\"\n\nLike many voters, he's put off thinking about the likelihood of another Trump-Biden showdown, hoping it might somehow be avoided.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit it: I haven\u2019t thought that far ahead,\" he said when asked what he would do if the rematch occurs.\n\n\"I\u2019ll think about it more when I have to,\" he added. \"That could be part denial.\"\n\nRead more: Schiff takes narrow lead in Senate race; tight contest for second, new poll shows\n\nModerate voters form a much larger bloc in the state than in most Republican primaries: Recent polls by Suffolk University of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire indicated, for example, that 41% of likely voters in New Hampshire's GOP primary define themselves as moderate or liberal, compared with 23% of likely caucusgoers in Iowa.\n\nBy contrast, evangelical Christians, the dominant force in the GOP in much of the country, made up only about a quarter of the vote in New Hampshire in 2016, according to exit polls, the last time Republicans had a nomination contest. Monday night in Iowa, evangelicals were 55% of the voters, according to the poll of caucus participants done by television networks.\n\nIn most of the rest of the country \u2014 including in Haley's home state of South Carolina, which holds its GOP primary on Feb. 24, and in California, which votes on March 5 \u2014the Republican electorate looks more like the voters in Iowa than those in New Hampshire.\n\nAlthough Haley is a southern conservative who has had strong evangelical backing in her career, she has become by default the candidate of northern moderates who want to defeat Trump. It's an alliance of convenience more than enthusiasm, but provides an outlet for a group that has increasingly been pushed to \u2014 or beyond \u2014 the margins of Republican politics.\n\nSeveral polls released last week showed Haley closing in on the lead here, with Trump holding about 4 in 10 likely voters and the former South Carolina governor supported by between a quarter and a third of them, depending on the survey.\n\nPolls and interviews with voters indicate that she'll probably pick up most of those who had backed Christie, which could give Haley most of the votes she would need to close the gap with Trump.\n\nNew Hampshire's postcard image is of rural towns built around churches with picturesque white steeples. In reality, the majority of the state's population lives in suburbs within hailing distance of the Boston metropolis.\n\nAnd while the state's voters are no longer representative of the Republican Party, they do roughly resemble a key nationwide voting bloc \u2014 the type of mostly white, middle-of-the-road suburbanites who have abandoned the GOP in droves in the Trump era and who played a major role in driving Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nJack Lagasse, an independent voter who attended the Christie event, said he expected to vote for Biden, despite worries about \"his age, and the fact that if he doesn\u2019t make it through the presidency, we\u2019ll end up with Kamala Harris as the president.\u201d\n\nBiden will be 82 and Trump 78 by inauguration day 2025, which falls on Haley's 53rd birthday.\n\nRead more: California-bashing is a constant occurrence on Iowa campaign trail\n\nLagasse said he would vote for the Democrat \"because of the vendetta that Trump has for everybody and the fact that he didn\u2019t want to give up the presidency the last time.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to try to turn this country into a dictatorship,\" he said, noting the argument that Trump's lawyers had made to an appeals court earlier that day that unless he was impeached first, he would be immune from prosecution for any crime he may have committed while president, even if he ordered the military to assassinate a political rival.\n\nWhile Trump's core supporters express fervent enthusiasm for his candidacy, other Republicans show a marked reluctance even when they say they expect they'll vote for him in the end.\n\nAsked what she would do if faced with a Trump-Biden matchup, Christina Austin, an executive assistant at an auto parts company in Dover, on New Hampshire's coast, gave a long sigh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not certain,\" she said.\n\n\"Biden\u2019s been very, very weak\" and is \"not doing a lot of good for the country,\" she said, but she added that Trump and his family have a lot of \"baggage.\"\n\nRead more: With her California dream broken, she found a political haven in Iowa\n\nThe moderate Republicans and independents who say they may vote for Biden aren't all new defectors from the GOP ranks. Many voted for Biden in 2020 and are drawn to this year's GOP primary largely as a chance to try to block Trump. But their continued disaffection is a reminder that even as Biden struggles with divisions in his party, Trump has alienated a significant share of what was once the Republican vote.\n\nIn Suffolk's New Hampshire poll, 7 in 10 Christie voters said they would back Biden in the event of a Trump-Biden race. And more than 4 in 10 Haley backers in Iowa would vote for Biden rather than Trump, a Des Moines Register/NBC News poll found.\n\nThe loss of such voters worries Ed Huminick, a real estate developer and local Republican official in his hometown of Salem, N.H., along the Massachusetts state line. A prominent Christie backer \u2014 and a potential convention delegate before the former New Jersey governor pulled out \u2014 he said he now plans to vote for Haley. But he is resigned to the likelihood that her efforts will be for naught.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I will hold my nose and vote Republican,\" he said, even if that means voting for Trump.\n\n\"I\u2019m 71 years old, and a Republican since I\u2019m 21 \u2014 50 years,\" he added. \"That's longer than Trump's been a Republican.\"\n\nBut, Huminick said, voters whose partisanship is not so ingrained won't do the same. New Hampshire, a closely divided state, has been slowly shifting toward the Democrats, especially in federal elections, and renominating Trump could create a tipping point for the state, he fears.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a Republican governor, a Republican state Senate and a Republican House,\" he said. \"I\u2019m concerned that \u2026 we\u2019ll have a Democratic governor, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House\" if Trump is the nominee.\n\nLike Paul Stover, many have simply decided not to decide for now, hoping that some combination of age, legal drama or mischance might avert a rematch they dread.\n\nWhen Christie pulled out of the race, he singled out for thanks one supporter, Toni Pappas, a Republican activist and chair of the board of commissioners for Hillsborough County, which includes Manchester, the state's largest city.\n\nAsked afterward whether she thought Trump was fit for office, Pappas said: \u201cNo, he is not.\u201d\n\nAsked what she would do if he were the party's nominee, she grimaced slightly before responding, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGet the best of the Los Angeles Times\u2019 politics coverage with the Essential Politics newsletter.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\n View comments",

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

An 11-year-old middle school student was killed in the shooting, and six other people were injured. The 17-year-old student who opened fire also died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nThe day after the shooting, the state Department of Public Safety said Marburger \u201cacted selflessly and placed himself in harm\u2019s way in an apparent effort to protect his students.\u201d\n\nNews of Marburger's death was first posted on a GoFundMe page for his family. The post, by Marburger's wife, Elizabeth, said he died at about 8 a.m. Sunday, and said: \u201cDan lost his battle. He fought hard and gave us 10 days that we will treasure forever.\u201d\n\nThe news that Marburger died triggered a flood of support on the Perry Facebook page with nearly 200 people posting condolences within the first hour after it was posted.\n\nIowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds offered her condolences.\n\n\u201cOur entire state is devastated by the news of Dan Marburger\u2019s death,\" she said in a statement Sunday. \"Dan courageously put himself in harm\u2019s way to protect his students, and ultimately gave his own life to save them. He will forever be remembered for his selfless and heroic actions. May he rest in peace.\u201d\n\nReynolds ordered all flags in Iowa to be lowered to half-staff on Sunday and to remain that way until sunset on the day of Marburger\u2019s funeral and interment. People, businesses, schools and local governments are also encouraged to fly the flag at half-staff for the same length of time as a sign of respect, the statement said.\n\nIn a Facebook post on the night of the shooting, the principal\u2019s daughter, Claire Marburger, called her father a \u201cgentle giant\u201d and said it wasn\u2019t surprising that her father tried to protect his students.\n\n\u201cAs I heard of a gunman, I instantly had a feeling my Dad would be a victim as he would put himself in harms way for the benefit of the kids and his staff,\u201d his daughter wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s just Dad.\u201d\n\nMarburger had been principal since 1995.\n\nIowa Division of Criminal Investigation spokesman Mitch Mortvedt said after the shooting that Marburger did some \u201cpretty significant things\u201d to protect others, but didn\u2019t release details. Perry Superintendent Clark Wicks said Marburger was a \u201chero\u201d who intervened with the teenage gunman so students could escape.\n\nAn 11-year-old sixth grader, Ahmir Jolliff, was killed in the shooting. Authorities said he was shot three times.\n\nThe shooting happened just after 7:30 a.m. on Jan. 4, shortly before classes were set to begin on the first day back after winter break. Mortvedt said the shooting started in the cafeteria, where students from several grades were eating breakfast, then spilled outside the cafeteria but was contained to the north end of the school.\n\nAuthorities said the suspect, identified as Dylan Butler, had a pump-action shotgun and a small-caliber handgun. Mortvedt told The Associated Press that authorities also found a \u201cpretty rudimentary\u201d improvised explosive device in Butler\u2019s belongings, and that experts advised \u201cit was something that they needed to disarm.\u201d It was rendered safe.\n\nThe GoFundMe page for Marburger was further updated on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAll of the Marburger family and the entire Perry Community will forever be touched by the selflessness of Mr. Marburger. This GoFundMe will continue to be used for the Marburger family as they process through and live out Dan\u2019s legacy,\" it said.\n\n___\n\nAhmed reported from Minneapolis.

Prosecutors claim he ran a virtual tax preparation business that provided customers with tax returns beyond what they were actually owed, defrauding the government.\n\n\u201cCastro would promise a significantly higher refund than taxpayers could receive from other preparers and on many occasions, offered to split the additional refund with taxpayers,\u201d prosecutors said in court documents. \u201cIn order to achieve these larger refunds, Castro generated false deductions, that were not based in fact, and which were submitted without the taxpayer\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\n\nCastro was busted by an undercover police officer, prosecutors outlined, who posed as a customer for his tax services. While a reputable tax preparer promised the undercover agent a $373 tax return, Castro instead claimed he could get $6,007, and offered to split the difference in extra cash.\n\nThe tax forms Castro then filed on behalf of the undercover officer contained nearly $30,000 in fraudulently claimed deductions, prosecutors said.\n\nTop Stories from The Hill\n\nTrump lawyer goes on defense after assassination comment: \u2018He didn\u2019t kill anyone\u2019\n\nHunter Biden makes surprise appearance at contempt of Congress hearing\n\nChris Christie drops out of 2024 race\n\nGOP senators slap down Trump on Jan. 6 \u2018hostages\u2019\n\nCastro is also a 2024 GOP presidential candidate, a long-shot bid that has gained little attention outside his legal challenges to Trump\u2019s ballot eligibility. Castro has filed challenges to Trump\u2019s ballot placement in 27 states, claiming that Trump\u2019s involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots violates the 14th Amendment.\n\nHe was indicted on the same day that his ballot challenge in New Hampshire was dismissed. His attempts have also been thrown out in Florida and most recently in Nevada on Tuesday. While multiple 14th Amendment suits remain pending, none have gained significant traction.\n\nHowever, other challenges to Trump\u2019s eligibility using the same arguments have succeeded, with attempts in Colorado and Maine both taking Trump off the states\u2019 ballots, pending action from the Supreme Court. The high court said last week that it will hear the merits of the Colorado case.\n\nCastro told The Hill that he denies wrongdoing and believes the case is politically motivated, \u201cno question about it.\u201d\n\nHe said his firm settled the tax return matter with the IRS in 2021, claiming that certain clients misinterpreted tax law. Castro said his firm paid back about $700,000 in 2021 to resolve the discrepancies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they offered me one day probation and a slap on the wrist in exchange for a guilty plea,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to trial. I am going to convince all 12 jurors that I am 100 percent innocent and that this is political retaliation.\u201d\n\nCastro claimed the prosecution is related to his 14th Amendment challenges against Trump due to timing of the indictment. The alleged fraudulent returns were filed between 2018 and 2020.\n\nHe also said a stipulation of his release keeping him inside the Northern District of Texas without prior permission could endanger upcoming appearances for 14th Amendment challenges in West Virginia, Kansas and Montana.\n\nCastro is due back in court Jan. 17.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n\n View comments",

Chris Murphy provided an update on the gun-control negotiations he's been leading.\n\nSpeaking on CNN Thursday morning, Murphy said he remains unusually confident in the talks.\n\nAs one of the compromises, raising the age to buy semiautomatic rifles is off the table, he said.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut confirmed to CNN on Thursday morning that raising the federal age to purchase AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles to 21 is off the table in Senate gun-control talks.\n\nMurphy, the Democrat leading the negotiations in conjunction with Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, framed the shift as one of the compromises that will be needed to get at least 10 Republican votes, given the obstacle of the filibuster.\n\nThe compromise, Murphy explained, would be adding \"additional scrutiny\" to 18- to 21-year-olds looking to buy a weapon like the AR-15, though he stopped short of specifying that some sort of waiting period would replace raising the age.\n\n\"I think we continue to try to find a path to 60 votes that includes some provision that recognizes these 18- to 21-year-olds tend to be the mass shooters, and that many times, they have juvenile criminal records or past histories of mental health that should prohibit them from buying a weapon,\" Murphy said, adding he thinks there is some Republican support for raising the age, but not enough to meet the 60-vote threshold to clear the filibuster.\n\nThe senator also said a federal red-flag law won't be in the package. Instead, there will be \"incentives\" for states to pass one or strengthen their existing versions, which allow police, teachers, and family members to petition a court to remove weapons from a gun owner deemed a violent threat.\n\nMurphy added that a complication in the waiting period is how different states handle legal records for minors, with some states sealing juvenile records.\n\nWhile Murphy repeatedly acknowledged that major legislation on gun violence has been stagnant in Congress for about 30 years, he added that he has been surprised by how far the negotiations have gotten. Murphy was also at the center of negotiations for a gun-control package following the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in his home state in 2012, which ultimately fell apart following a lack of GOP support.\n\n\"I think that we can put together a package that will get more than 10 Republican votes, and the reason for that is the demand from their constituents,\" Murphy said. \"I've never been part of a negotiation that was this serious.\"\n\nBut the Connecticut senator hedged his optimism.\n\n\"I still think there are more paths to failure than there are to success,\" Murphy said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\n View comments (266)",

                    "body": "Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has ceased his campaign to be the Republican nominee for president, he said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nHutchinson came in sixth place in the Iowa Republican caucuses held Monday night, with 0.2% of the vote.\n\nHutchinson stood out on the campaign trail as one of the few GOP candidates to firmly rebuke former President Donald Trump, the race\u2019s front-runner. His statement ending his campaign continued that criticism.\n\n\u201cMy message of being a principled Republican with experience and telling the truth about the current front runner did not sell in Iowa,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI answered every question, sounded the warning to the GOP about the risks in 2024 and presented hope for our country\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nHutchinson previously spoke out against the Republican National Committee\u2019s debate stage requirement that candidates vow to support whomever becomes the party\u2019s nominee, stating he could not endorse Trump if he\u2019s convicted on federal charges.\n\nThough Hutchinson ultimately signed the pledge, he and his fellow candidate at the time Chris Christie were the only ones at the first GOP debate not to raise their hands when asked if they\u2019d support Trump as the nominee if he\u2019s found guilty on any of the dozens of charges on which he\u2019s been indicted.\n\nHe also slammed his fellow candidates for pledging to pardon Trump if elected.\n\n\u201cI think that anybody who promises pardons during the presidential campaign is not serving our system of justice well, and it\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Hutchinson told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in July.\n\nIn early November, Hutchinson revealed that he did not file paperwork to appear on the primary ballot in South Carolina, as both its former Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott have a much better shot of winning there.\n\n\u201cI went to college in SC and met my bride there so I love the state but this is the best way to elect non-Trump delegates,\u201d Hutchinson posted on X, expressing a desire not to further split the vote among Trump\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe $50,000 fee to file to run in the South Carolina primary also amounted to more than 15% of the funds Hutchinson\u2019s campaign reported having in October, NBC News found.\n\nThe former Arkansas governor failed to qualify for the second GOP debate in September.\n\nHutchinson \u2015 a far-right conservative on abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and energy reform \u2015 first launched his presidential campaign in April in his hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, at the same spot where he announced an unsuccessful Senate bid in 1986.\n\n\u201cI ran as a conservative Republican when being a Republican was like having a career-ending handicap,\u201d he said at the April launch, continuing, \u201cAnd now, I bring that same vigor to fight another battle, and that battle is for the future of our country and the soul of our party.\u201d\n\nHutchinson first won a House seat representing Arkansas in 1996. He left that post to lead former President George W. Bush\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration from 2001 to 2003.\n\nHe ran an unsuccessful campaign for Arkansas governor in 2006, losing to a Democrat, then won the position in 2015. He served as governor from 2015 to 2023, when he was termed out.\n\nLiza Hearon contributed to this article.\n\nRelated...\n\nGOP Debate Stage Down To Just 1 Candidate Who Wouldn't Back A Convicted Trump\n\nNikki Haley Says She Is Confident Americans Won't Vote For A Convicted Felon\n\nRon DeSantis Goes Balls In Against Trump With Absolutely Bizarre New Challenge\n\n View comments",

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cHe has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming debates were slated to take place before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

The president, whom Republicans assail as too \"feeble\" and ineffective on issues like inflation and immigration, is pushing back on his would-be opponents, labeling them as election deniers enthralled to Trump-style rhetoric and opposed to abortion rights.\n\n\"There is no difference between the Republican candidates in the field ... all of these Republican candidates are singing the same, terrible song,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a press conference on Monday, focusing his remarks on contrasts between Biden and Donald Trump, the GOP primary front-runner.\n\nBiden's campaign dispatched top allies to Iowa ahead of the caucuses, including Pritzker, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, to counterprogram Republicans' message even as they acknowledge many voters still aren't fully tuned in.\n\nMORE: Pritzker downplays Biden's poor polling, says 2024 will be race against 'MAGA Republicans'\n\nA campaign official said they will have a war room set up at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, to monitor the Iowa caucuses. Aides will dissect data like results from precincts and GOP turnout.\n\nThe president has his own issues. He's received months of poor or mediocre polling and has an approval rating mired in the 30s, according to 538. Republicans \"think anyone can beat him,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\n\nPritzker seemed to acknowledge that on Monday, telling reporters, \"Joe Biden has yet to have had a battle ... between the Republicans and run against a single Republican. So until we see that, we won't know really what the numbers are.\"\n\nBiden campaign officials told ABC News that their internal research shows voters are not yet paying close attention to the general election, set for Nov. 5.\n\nA senior campaign aide said that their data shows around three-in-four undecided voters do not yet believe that Trump will be the Republican presidential nominee, despite his persistent polling lead.\n\nPHOTO: President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event at Montgomery County Community College in Blue Bell, Pa., Jan. 5, 2024. (Stephanie Scarbrough/AP)\n\nOnce the choice between Trump and Biden crystalizes, the president's campaign believes Americans will be turned off by a MAGA message seen as dark and out of touch.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign will continue to remind voters of the threats they see from a second Trump presidency because of Trump's embrace of Jan. 6 and other rhetoric. (Trump, for his part, has tried to turn Biden's attack back around on him.)\n\nThough the Biden campaign has polling problems, it has been quick to tout its financial advantages: Biden is entering the election year with $117 million in cash on hand, the highest amount raised by any Democratic candidate in history at this point in the cycle.\n\nCampaign officials said that while Republican candidates, including Trump, are expected to have to keep spending cash to battle in the primary, the Biden campaign -- which faces no significant primary threat -- can target funds on battleground states and save some spending for months closer to the general election.\n\nOne of those battleground states is Pennsylvania, which Biden has already visited three times since 2024 began.\n\nPart of that is convenience: The state is the easiest of the battlegrounds for Biden to get to, a campaign official said.\n\nThis official addded that Pennsylvania has many critical voter groups for Democrats, including working-class voters, blue-collar voters, swing voters and many Black and Latino voters.\n\nBut, at this early stage in the 2024 race, the campaign official made clear that they are also focused on other swing states, with pilot programs in Arizona and Wisconsin. The official said to expect the president to travel to other battleground states in the coming months.\n\nBiden campaign weighs in on Iowa caucuses: Candidates all 'singing the same, terrible song' originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\n View comments",

Mitt Romney of Utah says he believes members of Congress are not paid enough.\n\nMembers of the House and Senate are paid $174,000 annually, and have been since 2009. Majority and minority leaders make $193,400, while the speaker of the House makes $223,500.\n\nBut Congress isn't like any old job: Most members travel back and forth between DC and their home districts twice a week, and they need somewhere to sleep when they're in the nation's capital.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who briefly served as the interim speaker of the House following Kevin McCarthy's ouster, told The Dispatch last week that members of Congress aren't paid enough.\n\nAsked about McHenry's comments by Business Insider, Romney declared: \"I agree.\"\n\n\"You have quite a number of members of Congress that sleep in their offices,\" said Romney. \"In this day and age, it makes sense to have people that feel that they can serve, and still be able to sleep in a home at night.\"\n\nHe's not wrong about people sleeping in their offices.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a man of relatively modest means, has long slept in his Capitol Hill office. And former House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 Romney's running mate in 2012 \u2014 was known to do the same thing.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem were also known to sleep in their offices. Not all of them do it out of financial necessity \u2014 some do it as a gesture of fiscal responsibility.\n\nBut many lawmakers do, in fact, sleep in their offices because they can't afford DC rent on top of all of their other expenses.\n\n\"We don't know for sure how many people sleep in their offices. I was one of those,\" former Rep. Gregg Harper testified to a House committee in 2022, saying he \"couldn't afford $2,000, $2,500 a month\" in rent.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\n View comments",

ABC News planned to partner with WMUR-TV to host a debate on Thursday, and CNN announced it would host a debate on Sunday.\n\nBut with both Trump and Haley declining to participate, an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday evening that its debate is off. \"Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race,\" the network spokesperson said.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment and has not made any public comment about its scheduling.\n\nHaley\u2019s challenge toward Trump comes after the former U.N. ambassador finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Trump was the far favorite, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in second place.\n\n\nWhile DeSantis has accepted the invite to the CNN debate, Trump has already scheduled a New Hampshire rally for Sunday.\n\nDeSantis said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Haley \"is afraid to debate because she doesn\u2019t want to answer the tough questions\" and accused her of running to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"I won\u2019t snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,\" DeSantis said in the post. \"I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week.\"\n\nHaley on Monday night claimed that her close third-place result had made the campaign a head-to-head race between her and Trump.\n\n\u201cI can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\u201d Haley said.\n\nLisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "Eight years after he lost the Iowa caucuses \u2212 and three years after his White House tenure ended in electoral defeat and Capitol Hill violence \u2212 Donald Trump on Monday launched the political year by scoring the biggest victory in the history of the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe GOP is Trump's party now.\n\nHis striking comeback after the political chaos of Jan. 6 doesn't guarantee he will claim the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin this summer. But his unprecedented 51% finish, crushing Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley by 30 percentage points, left his would-be challengers scrambling to articulate a credible path to slow Trump's roll.\n\nGoodbye, Iowa. Hello, New Hampshire.\n\n\"This is really time for our country to come together,\" Trump said in a victory speech in Des Moines that sounded as though he was turning to the general election against President Joe Biden, the Republican Party already consolidated. \"It would be so nice if we could come together and straighten out the world and straighten out the problems.\"\n\nDuring the Iowa campaign, he had derided DeSantis and Haley. Now he praised them. \"I think they both actually did very well,\" he said, and he mentioned the number of calls he was getting from Republican officials newly eager to endorse him. \"And we love them all,\" he said.\n\nWhat gives Haley hope?\n\nThere's this: Iowa has a sorry record in signaling the Republican presidential nominee. In the last seven contested caucuses, five of the winners failed to win the nomination, much less the White House. In 2016, for one, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz edged Trump.\n\nThat's why Haley told an audience last week that New Hampshire \"corrects\" Iowa \u2212 a comment she made to a New Hampshire audience, naturally, not an Iowa one.\n\nThe former U.N. ambassador finished a disappointing third, at 19.1%, just an edge behind DeSantis, the Florida governor, at 21.2%. His distant second place was disappointing, too, and their near-tie was a messy finish for both contenders. She hopes her competitiveness as a Trump alternative gives her momentum into New Hampshire and its first-in-the-nation primary, which has a history of surprise.\n\n\"When you look at how we're doing in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and beyond, I can safely say, tonight, Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race,\" she told her supporters, congratulating Trump but not mentioning DeSantis. She then tied Trump to Biden as aging leaders who are \"consumed by the past.\"\n\n\"America deserves better,\" she went on. \"Our campaign is the last, best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare.\"\n\nThe decision last week by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fierce Trump critic, to suspend his campaign could give her a bit of a boost. She's been endorsed by the state's governor, Chris Sununu.\n\nThat said, before Iowa's vote, Trump was leading Haley in New Hampshire 43.4% to 30.3% in recent statewide polls averaged by fivethirtyeight.com. He led her 46%-26% in a USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll last week.\n\nIf Trump isn't tripped in New Hampshire, it's hard to spot another potential opening anytime soon. He leads Haley by more than 2-1 in her home state of South Carolina, the next primary. He leads DeSantis by 9-1 in the Nevada caucuses that follow.\n\nDeSantis' dilemma: He bet the farm on Iowa\n\nWhen he entered the race, the two-term governor of Florida was seen as the strongest prospect to challenge Trump. He repeatedly vowed to beat the former president in Iowa.\n\nAs his campaign foundered, DeSantis focused his resources on Iowa. His credentials as a cultural warrior in Florida were considered a good fit with Iowa's conservative electorate, and he was endorsed by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. He made a stop in each of the state's 99 counties in what is known as \"the full Grassley,\" named after the Iowa senator who has made his travels even to the state's smallest and most isolated areas his trademark.\n\nWith all that, DeSantis' failure to finish even a decisive second raised questions about how long he can raise money and attract support to keep his campaign alive.\n\n\"They threw everything but the kitchen sink at us,\" he told his supporters after it was clear he would finish second, not third. His manner was ebullient. \"In spite of all that they threw at us, everybody against us, we got our ticket punched out of Iowa.\"\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a political newcomer with this race, didn't get his ticket punched out of Iowa. After finishing in single digits, at 7.7%, he announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson fared even worse, at less than 1%. He suspended his campaign Tuesday morning.\n\nTrump's stunning sweep\n\nWhat made Trump's victory so stunning was not only its size but also its sweep.\n\nThe Associated Press declared him the winner just 31 minutes after the caucus had started at 7 p.m. Central time, though the magnitude of the Trump wave wasn't clear until the thousands of paper ballots were filled out, counted and reported hours later.\n\nAccording to surveys of voters as they entered the caucus sites at community halls and school gymnasiums across the state, Trump led among those who described themselves as \"very conservative\" \u2212 more than half of the total electorate, higher than in the 2016 caucuses \u2212 and among those who said they were independents. He led among those with college degrees by a small margin and among those without them by a huge one.\n\nTwo-thirds said they believed Trump's debunked allegation that Joe Biden wasn't legitimately elected president in 2020.\n\nBut there was a warning flag for Trump, too. Nearly a third of Republican caucusgoers said they would view him as unfit for the presidency if he were convicted of a crime.\n\nHe now faces 91 felony charges in four indictments, two in federal court and two in state courts, in New York and Georgia.\n\nHe left Iowa after claiming victory to fly to New York to attend in person the opening of a trial that will determine what additional damages he must pay writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him of rape. Last spring, another jury awarded her about $5 million for sexual assault.\n\nHistory's lesson\n\nSince the advent of presidential primaries in modern times, no candidate in either party who has carried both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary had been denied their party's nomination.\n\nIf Trump manages to complete that one-two punch, the chances of wrestling the nomination from his hands go from being a long-shot upset to a Hail-Mary pass.\n\nWill this race still be meaningfully contested by Super Tuesday on March 5?\n\nCheck back next week.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump scores huge political comeback with historic Iowa victory\n\n View comments (1.6k)",

The Haley campaign held the town hall via teleconference which was held after a blizzard forced it to cancel a planned in-person event in Dubuque, Iowa.\n\n\"We shouldn\u2019t have them permanently change their body until they\u2019re 18,\" Haley told the voter, according to audio of the event first obtained by the Daily Caller. \"After the age of 18, we want to make sure people can live any way they want to live. I don\u2019t think government needs to be in control of anybody\u2019s life. You go live the way you want to live, you should be free to live the way you want to live. And government and everybody else should stay out of your way.\"\n\n\"I think that, you know, you always have to believe in freedom and allowing people to live life the way they want to live, and if that\u2019s how they choose then, you know, I don\u2019t think government should have any say in that,\" the former ambassador continued.\n\nLIVE BLOG: TRUMP, HALEY, DESANTIS FACE OFF AT IOWA CAUCUSES IN GOP 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE\n\nHaley added that she strongly believed children under the age of 18 years old should not be legally allowed to proceed with any gender surgeries.

                    "body": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Maine\u2019s Democratic secretary of state on Thursday removed former President Donald Trump from the state\u2019s presidential primary ballot under the Constitution\u2019s insurrection clause, becoming the first election official to take action unilaterally as the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to decide whether Trump remains eligible to return to the White House.\n\nThe decision by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows follows a ruling earlier this month by the Colorado Supreme Court that booted Trump from the ballot there under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. That decision has been stayed until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether Trump is barred by the Civil War-era provision, which prohibits those who \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from holding office.\n\nThe Trump campaign said it would appeal Bellows' decision to Maine's state courts, and Bellows suspended her ruling until that court system rules on the case. In the end, it is likely that the nation's highest court will have the final say on whether Trump appears on the ballot in Maine and in the other states.\n\nBellows found that Trump could no longer run for his prior job because his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol violated Section 3, which bans from office those who \u201cengaged in insurrection.\u201d Bellows made the ruling after some state residents, including a bipartisan group of former lawmakers, challenged Trump\u2019s position on the ballot.\n\n\u201cI do not reach this conclusion lightly,\u201d Bellows wrote in her 34-page decision. \u201cI am mindful that no Secretary of State has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. I am also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign immediately slammed the ruling. \u201cWe are witnessing, in real-time, the attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter,\u201d campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.\n\nLegal experts said that Thursday's ruling demonstrates the need for the nation's highest court, which has never ruled on Section 3, to clarify what states can do.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that these decisions are going to keep popping up, and inconsistent decisions reached (like the many states keeping Trump on the ballot over challenges) until there is final and decisive guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles, wrote in response to the Maine decision. \u201cIt seems a certainty that SCOTUS will have to address the merits sooner or later.\u201d\n\nWhile Maine has just four electoral votes, it\u2019s one of two states to split them. Trump won one of Maine\u2019s electors in 2020, so having him off the ballot there, should he emerge as the Republican general election candidate, could have outsized implications in a race that is expected to be narrowly decided.\n\nThat's in contrast to Colorado, which Trump lost by 13 percentage points in 2020 and where he wasn't expected to compete in November if he wins the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nIn her decision, Bellows acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court will probably have the final word but said it was important she did her official duty.\n\nThat won her praise from the former state lawmakers who filed one of the petitions forcing her to consider the case.\n\n\u201cSecretary Bellows showed great courage in her ruling, and we look forward to helping her defend her judicious and correct decision in court. No elected official is above the law or our constitution, and today\u2019s ruling reaffirms this most important of American principles,\u201d Republican Kimberley Rosen, independent Thomas Saviello and Democrat Ethan Strimling said in a statement.\n\nBut other Republicans in the state were outraged.\n\n\"The Secretary of State\u2019s decision would deny thousands of Mainers the opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choice, and it should be overturned,\" U.S. Sen. Susan Collins wrote on the social media site X.\n\n\u201cThis is a sham decision that mimics Third World dictatorships,\" Maine's House Republican leader, Billy Bob Faulkingham, said in a statement. \u201cIt will not stand legal scrutiny. People have a right to choose their leaders devoid of mindless decisions by partisan hacks.\u201d\n\nThe criticism wasn't just along normal partisan lines, though. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who represents Maine's 2nd congressional district that Trump won in 2020, noted on X that he'd voted to impeach Trump for the Jan. 6 attack and doesn't believe he should win next year's election.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are a nation of laws, and therefore until he is actually found guilty of the crime of insurrection, he should be allowed on the ballot,\u201d Golden wrote.\n\nThe Trump campaign on Tuesday requested that Bellows disqualify herself from the case because she'd previously tweeted that Jan. 6 was an \"insurrection\u201d and bemoaned that Trump was acquitted in his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate after the capitol attack. She refused to step aside.\n\n\u201cMy decision was based exclusively on the record presented to me at the hearing and was in no way influenced by my political affiliation or personal views about the events of Jan. 6, 2021,\u201d Bellows told the Associated Press Thursday night.\n\nBellows is a former head of the Maine chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. All seven of the justices of the Colorado Supreme Court, which split 4-3 on whether to become the first court in history to declare a presidential candidate ineligible under Section 3, were appointed by Democrats. Two Washington, D.C.-based liberal groups have launched the most serious prior challenges to Trump, in Colorado and a handful of other states.\n\nThat's led Trump to contend the dozens of lawsuits nationwide seeking to remove him from the ballot under Section 3 are a Democratic plot to end his campaign. But some of the most prominent advocates have been conservative legal theorists who argue that the text of the Constitution makes the former president ineligible to run again, just as if he failed to clear the document's age threshold \u2014 35 years old \u2014 for the office.\n\nLikewise, until Bellows' decision, every top state election official, whether Democrat or Republican, had rejected requests to bar Trump from the ballot, saying they didn't have the power to remove him unless ordered to do so by a court.\n\nIn California, which has the largest trove of delegates in the 2024 presidential contest, Trump was included on the certified list of candidates released Thursday for the state\u2019s March 5 primary.\n\nSecretary of State Shirley Weber faced political pressure to reject Trump\u2019s candidacy in the state, including from Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a fellow Democrat who urged her in a Dec. 20 letter to \u201cexplore every legal option\u201d to remove the former president from the California ballot. Weber later responded that she was guided by \u201cthe rule of law,\u201d and indicated the proper venue to resolve ballot challenges was in the courts.\n\nThe timing on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision is unclear, but both sides want it fast. Colorado's Republican Party appealed the Colorado high court decision on Wednesday, urging an expedited schedule, and Trump is also expected to file an appeal within the week. The petitioners in the Colorado case on Thursday urged the nation's highest court to adopt an even faster schedule so it could rule before March 5, known as Super Tuesday, when 16 states, including Colorado and Maine, are scheduled to vote in the Republican presidential nominating process.\n\nThe high court needs to formally accept the case first, but legal experts consider that a certainty. The Section 3 cases seem tailor-made for the Supreme Court, addressing an area of U.S. governance where there's scant judicial guidance.\n\nThe clause was added in 1868 to keep defeated Confederates from returning to their former positions of power in local and federal government. It prohibits anyone who broke an oath to \u201csupport\u201d the Constitution from holding office. The provision was used to bar a wide range of ex-Confederates from positions ranging from local sheriff to Congress, but fell into disuse after an 1872 congressional amnesty for most former Confederates.\n\nLegal historians believe the only time the provision was used in the 20th Century was in 1919, when it was cited to deny a House seat to a socialist who had opposed U.S. involvement in World War I. But since the Jan. 6 attack, it has been revived.\n\nLast year, it was cited by a court to remove a rural New Mexico County Commissioner who had entered the Capitol on Jan. 6. One liberal group tried to remove Republican Reps. Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene from the 2022 ballot under the provision, but Cawthorn lost his primary so his case was thrown out, and a judge ruled for Greene.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael R.

(AP) \u2014 The Louisiana Legislature passed a congressional map with a second majority-Black district on Friday, marking a win for Democrats and civil rights groups after a legal battle and political tug-of-war that spanned nearly two years.\n\nDemocrats have long fought for a second majority-minority district among Louisiana's six congressional districts \u2014 arguing that the political boundaries passed by the GOP-dominated legislature in 2022 discriminates against Black voters, who make up one-third of Louisiana\u2019s population. The change could deliver an additional seat in Congress to the Democratic Party.\n\nThe GOP has resisted drawing another minority district, arguing that the 2022 map is fair and constitutional. But in an about-face this special legislative session, the map received bipartisan support after Republicans said their hands had been tied by a looming Jan. 30 court-mandated deadline and fears that a federal judge, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, would redraw the map herself if the task was not by completed lawmakers.\n\nThe legislation now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, where it is expected to receive his seal of approval. During the special session this week, Landry has repeatedly urged the Legislature to adopt a new map that would satisfy the court, instead of possibly putting the task in the hands of \u201csome heavy-handed federal judge.\u201d\n\nLouisiana is among the states who were wrangling over congressional districts after the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that Alabama had violated the Voting Rights Act.\n\nUnder the new map, 54% of the voting-age population in the district currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves would be Black \u2014 up from the current 23%. Graves opposes the plan, saying in a statement to The Advocate that it \u201cignore(s) the redistricting principles of compactness and communities of interest.\u201d Other Republicans on the state House and Senate floors echoed this concern.\n\nGOP state Rep. Glen Womack, who filed the legislation, said that race was not the \u201cpredominate factor\u201d in deciding where the new boundaries would lie, but rather \u201cpolitics drove this map.\" Womack said he prioritized protecting the seats of U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as that of Congresswoman Julia Letlow, who represents Womack\u2019s region and sits on the powerful House Committee on Appropriations.\n\nUnder the 2022 map, which was used in last November's election, there is one majority-Black district \u2014 the 2nd District, which encompasses most of New Orleans and stretches to Baton Rouge, and is represented by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter. Carter is the state's sole Black and Democratic member of Congress.\n\nThe 2022 map has been at the center of political woes in the state Capitol, with former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoing the political boundaries and the Legislature overriding his veto \u2014 their first override of a governor\u2019s veto in nearly three decades.\n\nIn June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick struck down Louisiana\u2019s map for violating the Voting Rights Act. Dick said in her ruling that \u201cevidence of Louisiana\u2019s long and ongoing history of voting-related discrimination weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs.\u201d\n\n View comments (30)",

We want to handcuff bad people. That\u2019s the goal,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure we\u2019re not preventing them from doing their job.\u201d\n\nHours later \u2014 and with decidedly less fanfare \u2014 the mayor's office announced that he had also vetoed the solitary confinement bill, citing concerns raised by a federal monitor appointed to evaluate operations at the city's jails.\n\n\u201cUnder our administration, the city\u2019s jails are getting safer \u2014 but this bill would have taken us in the wrong direction,\u201d Adams said in the written announcement.\n\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, a fellow Democrat who is not related to the mayor, confirmed that the council was prepared to override him on both fronts.\n\nShe argued that the jail restrictions are needed to address problems at Riker's Island, which faces possible federal takeover in order to curb violence at the infamous island jail complex. She also pushed back at the mayor's claims that solitary confinement has not been utilized in city jails for years.\n\n\u201cSolitary confinement, by any name, has been proven to cause physical, psychological, and emotional harm, and its use has contributed to continued violence and deaths on Rikers Island,\" the speaker said in a statement \u201cWe cannot allow the human rights and safety crisis on Rikers to continue by maintaining the status quo of failed policies and practices. \u201d\n\nShe also argued the policing bill was warranted because civilian complaints against officers are at their highest level in more than a decade.\n\n\u201cThe false narrative that we cannot have transparency is bad for our city, and belies the fact that accountability is vital to improving public safety by increasing trust,\u201d Adams said in a separate statement.\n\nThe solitary confinement bill would place a four-hour limit on isolating inmates who pose an immediate risk of violence to others or themselves in \u201cde-escalation\u201d units.\n\nOnly those involved in violent incidents could be placed in longer-term restrictive housing, and they would need to be allowed out of their cells for 14 hours each day and get access to the same programming available to other inmates.\n\nThe policing bill, known as the \u201c How Many Stops Act,\u201d requires officers to publicly report on all investigative stops, including relatively low-level encounters with civilians.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation would require the NYPD to report on where the stops happen, demographic information on the person stopped, the reason for the encounter, and whether the encounter led to any use-of-force or enforcement action.\n\nPolice are currently only required to fill out reports following stops in which they question and search civilians.\n\nThe council approved the two measures in the final days of 2023 with enough votes backing both bills to overrule a mayoral veto and ensure they become law, unless several members change their stance.\n\nLocal groups that supported the measures urged the council to immediately hold an override vote.\n\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who introduced the bills, dismissed Adams\u2019 criticism as \u201cfear-mongering\u201d and misinformation.\n\n\u201cA full understanding of the legislation makes it clear that enacting these reforms will be good for public safety, while preventing them will make our city less safe,\u201d he said in a statement ahead of the mayor\u2019s vetoes.\n\n___\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\n View comments",

                    "body": "More than a dozen public officials have been targeted by attempted \"swatting attacks\" in the weeks since Christmas, according to a review by CBS News. The calls have targeted judges overseeing cases against former President Donald Trump, politicians of both parties, a prosecutor, and even the White House \u00a0\u2014 part of a growing and alarming number of swatting incidents nationwide.\n\nWhat is swatting?\n\nSwatting is a dangerous and illegal scheme in which people make false emergency calls in an attempt to prompt police to dispatch SWAT teams to the homes of public figures, celebrities or enemies in an effort to harass and menace.\n\n\"This is an assassination attempt. That's what it is. They are looking for a violent act to happen at your home at the hands of the police,\" said Rep. Brandon Williams, a Republican who was the victim of a swatting incident on Christmas Day at his home in Cayuga County, New York.\n\nWilliams said the swatter, who has yet to be caught, made a hoax call claiming a shooting had occurred at Williams' home. As sheriff's deputies raced up Williams' driveway to respond, the first-term congressman walked out of his home and raised his hands in the air.\n\nWilliams told CBS News, \"You have to de-escalate and sort of disarm the situation, because the police have a job to do. And thank goodness they're willing to do that job.\"\n\nWho has been targeted by swatting calls?\n\nCBS News' review of police, FBI and court records shows other swatting attempts in the past three weeks against special counsel Jack Smith, who is overseeing the criminal prosecution of former President Donald Trump in Washington, and federal judge Tanya Chutkan, who is assigned to the case.\n\nOther recent swatting targets also include Sen. Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican; Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling; and the White House itself, where a false call about a suspected fire was made to emergency dispatchers Monday morning, prompting more than a dozen fire and EMS units to respond.\n\nMaine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows was targeted by a swatter after announcing her ruling that Trump's name should be removed from her state's primary election ballot. Bellows, a Democrat, told CBS News, \"I don't think it's any coincidence. I issued my ruling on a Thursday, and it was Friday evening that I got swatted.\"\n\n\"It seemed designed to share a message to scare me or silence me,\" Bellows said.\n\nAn FBI report shared with CBS News showed more than 500 swatting incidents nationwide since May. The first responders are often local police SWAT units who have no alternative but to robustly and urgently respond to the 911 calls, said former U.S. Secret Service deputy director A.T. Smith, who is a CBS News law enforcement consultant.\n\n\"These kinds of calls over and over again are going to drain their assets,\" Smith told CBS News. And he said each swatting response poses the risk of danger.\n\n\"It's not a joke like having someone deliver a pizza to your house. This is real. The response teams are all real. They're armed with real guns real ammunition. Someone who is oblivious to this may try to protect themselves just out of fear,\"\u00a0 Smith said. \"In the end someone who's totally innocent gets hurt or killed.\"\n\nA swatting response in Wichita, Kansas, in 2017 resulted in the fatal shooting by police of an innocent person. In that case, the caller, a man in Los Angeles, pleaded guilty and was\u00a0sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nSmith said, \"It's dangerous for the police because if they encounter someone at a residence, or where they've been dispatched, that knows nothing about this, they may defend themselves. It's a very harmful, dangerous scenario for all involved.\"\n\nNone of the swatting incidents targeting public officials in the recent outbreak have resulted in arrests.\n\nWilliams said the Christmas Day swatting incident at his home disrupted holiday celebrations and rattled his family members. He said his family asked, \"'Are you safe? What happens next? Who's the next person coming up the driveway?'\"\n\nAfter the unexpected drama of the police response was over, Williams said he handed the deputies small bags filled with holiday cookies. \"You have to empathize with the police who respond,\" he said.\n\nOne of the other recent swatting targets, Sen. Rick Scott, has proposed new legislation to expand criminal statutes to include swatting as a federal crime.\n\n\"This legislation would impose strict penalties for swatting, including up to 20 years in prison if someone is seriously hurt because of a swatting attack,\" Scott said.\n\nSpelman College receives historic $100 million donation\n\nWhy the LA Innocence Project is taking on Scott Peterson's murder case\n\nHealth information disclosed on King Charles and Princess Kate\n\n View comments",

Janet Mills and a state lawmaker who immigrated from Somalia unveiled a proposal on Friday to try to resolve the state's serious worker shortage by tapping swiftly growing immigrant communities.\n\nMaine traditionally has had among the smallest immigrant populations in the country. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, only about 4% of the state's residents were born outside the U.S.\n\nThat has been gradually changing as tens of thousands of residents descended from Somalia and other African countries have made homes in Portland and Lewiston, two of the state's biggest cities. Those arrivals helped push up the percentage of foreign-born residents by about a percentage point between 2000 to 2022, according to census figures.\n\nThe Office of New Americans is proposed in a bill by state Rep. Deqa Dhalac, the first Somali immigrant to become mayor of a U.S. city in 2021, when she took office in South Portland. She was elected to the Maine Legislature last year. Dhalac and Mills say the bill would address shortages in critical industries including health care, education and construction.\n\n\u201cImproving how Maine introduces and integrates New Americans into its communities and economy is viewed as one key strategy to address the state\u2019s workforce needs, as attracting and retaining new workers is a priority for Maine\u2019s economic future,\u201d they said in a news release.\n\nUnder Dhalac's bill, among the new office's primary activities would be providing pathways for immigrant employees to obtain professional accreditation and licenses. The office would also be responsible for \u201cengaging with businesses to increase employment, retention and advancement of immigrant employees,\u201d the proposal states.\n\nThe bill is due for a public hearing on Jan. 30.\n\nAt least 18 other states have offices or staff focused on bringing immigrants into the workforce, including in New England, where officials are coping with housing shortages while trying to welcome growing numbers of immigrants fleeing their homelands for the Northeast.\n\n View comments (200)",
