""Our intent was to host a debate coming out of the Iowa caucuses, but we always knew that would be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race. As a result, while our robust election coverage will continue, ABC News and WMUR-TV will not be moving forward with Thursday's Republican presidential primary debate in New Hampshire,"" an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.

Former President Donald Trump finished in first place in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis coming in second and Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, placing third, according to CBS News' projections.

Haley argued that her performance in Iowa makes the primary campaign a ""two-person race"" between her and Trump.

She said Tuesday that she would not participate in Thursday's debate unless Trump was also there, making DeSantis the only candidate who had committed to the event.

""I've done five debates,"" Haley told CBS News political correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns. ""He's done none. I want him on that stage. I welcome him when he says he's going to do it. We'll be there. But until then, I'm not going to bother.""

Trump has avoided debating his GOP rivals in any of the five primary debates, citing his dominant lead in the polls.

DeSantis and Haley were the only two candidates to participate in last week's debate hosted by CNN in Des Moines, Iowa, ahead of the state's caucuses.

Jean Carroll, Judge Lewis Kaplan, Carroll",Agitated Trump says 'I would love it' after judge threatens to boot him from E. Jean Carroll defamation trial,"The judge presiding over E. Jean Carroll's damages trial in New York federal court on Wednesday warned former President Donald Trump that he might bar him from the courtroom for grousing loudly and animatedly to his lawyer during Carroll's testimony about how he repeatedly defamed her. ""Mr.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8JyB4CHOXcesQK51mzhFqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/92a407246daad5325d905cf974dfc39d,"The judge presiding over E. Jean Carroll's damages trial in New York federal court on Wednesday warned former President Donald Trump that he might bar him from the courtroom for grousing loudly and animatedly to his lawyer during Carroll's testimony about how he repeatedly defamed her.

""Mr. Trump has the right to be present here. That right can be forfeited, and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive and if he disregards court orders,"" U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan told Trump and his attorney after the jury had left the courtroom. ""Mr. Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you are very eager for me to do that,"" the judge said.

""I would love it. I would love it,"" Trump responded.

""I know you would because you just can’t control yourself in this circumstance. You just can't,"" the judge shot back before an exasperated Trump threw his hands in the air.

Trump returned to court after lunch, and posted two attacks against the judge on his social media platform Truth Social at about the same time, calling Kaplan a ""seething and hostile Clinton-appointed Judge."" ""He is abusive, rude, and obviously not impartial but, that’s the way this crooked system works!"" he said in one of the posts.

In another post a short time later, Trump said, Kaplan ""should be sanctioned for his abuse of power — No wonder our Country is going to Hell!""

Trump, who was found liable last year for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll, had appeared visibly upset throughout Carroll's testimony.

“I am here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it he lied and he shattered my reputation,” Carroll, 80, told the jury.

Trump repeatedly shook his head in anger and made comments to his lawyer throughout Carroll's testimony. At one point, Kaplan told Trump's attorney to sit down after denying her objection. Trump slammed the table and commented to his attorney, ""nasty guy,"" apparently referring to the judge.

During the morning break, Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley told the judge that Trump had been loudly making comments, saying some statements were ""false"" and making cracks about Carroll's memory.

Before the jury returned, Kaplan said, ""I’m just going to ask Mr. Trump to take special care to keep his voice down so the jury does not overhear it.”

The request did not take. When the jury broke for lunch, Crowley told the judge that Trump had continued his commentary, and that some jurors could have heard him say ""this really is a con job"" and ""it's a witch hunt.""

That led to the back-and-forth with the judge.

After the parties returned from lunch, one of Trump's attorneys, Michael Madaio, complained to the judge that he had issued his warning to Trump ""without giving us a moment to respond"" to the Carroll team's claim that he was disruptive. Madaio told the judge he had displayed a ""general hostility towards the defense"" and asked him to recuse himself from the case.

""Denied,"" the judge said.

Kaplan also repeatedly chided Trump's lawyer Alina Habba throughout the day for not following his orders and procedure. When she tried reading from a document in the afternoon, the judge told her they were going to take a break and ""during that time you might want to refresh your memory about how it is you get a document into evidence.""

When Carroll first took the stand in the morning she walked past Trump, who was sitting at the defense table, as he looked in a different direction. She testified that Trump has repeatedly told lies about her since 2019, when she first came forward with allegations that he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room in a Manhattan department store in 1996.

She said she'd ""expected him to respond"" to her allegation when she first went public.

""I thought he was going to deny it and say it was consensual, which it was not,"" Carroll said. Instead, Trump said, ""I have never met this woman in my life,"" she said, adding, ""That is a lie.""

""He said I made it up to sell a book, and that is a lie,"" and ""said my false accusations damaged the real victims of assault, and that is a lie,"" Carroll said. She said the then-president declared ""people need to pay dearly,"" and ""I have paid as dearly as possible.""

Trump's statements ""ended the world I had been living in,"" Carroll said, adding that she found herself the target of hateful attacks from his supporters across Twitter and other social media. ""It happened instantaneously,"" she said, with many of her attackers using Trump's words.

""It was so unexpected,"" she said, and the ""messages have never stopped.""

""I receive them all the time, sometimes hundreds a day,"" she added. The jury was shown several of the threats she received, many with graphic threats of violence.

Her lawyer ended her direct examination by showing Trump's Truth Social posts bashing Carroll on Tuesday, while he was in court.

""I want my reputation back,"" Carroll said.

On cross-examination, Habba asked Carroll if she was called a liar online in the five hours between when New York Magazine ran an article with her accusations and Trump's public comments. ""Yes, because the White House denied it"" in the New York article, Carroll said. Asked if she sued the White House over the denial, Carroll said, ""No.""

In opening statements Tuesday, Crowley told the jury Trump “didn’t just deny the assault” when Carroll broke her silence — “he went much, much further,"" Crowley said. ""He said he had no idea who she was. He accused her of lying and making up a story to make money and to advance some political conspiracy against him. And he threatened her. He said she should pay dearly for speaking out against him.""

""Donald Trump was president when he made those statements, and he used the world's biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her and to destroy her reputation,"" she said.

Trump, 77, was found liable last year for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her after he left the White House in a separate civil trial and was hit with a $5 million verdict, which he's appealing. Kaplan used that verdict to find Trump liable for the remarks he made while he was president, as well, so the jury in the current case will be deciding only what amount of damages to award her.

Crowley noted that Trump had continued his attacks since the last verdict, including the posts on Truth Social while he was in court.

""He sat in this courthouse this morning. And while he was sitting there, he posted more defamatory statements, more lies about Ms. Carroll and this case. By our count, by our last count, 22 posts just today. Think about that. Think about that when you consider how much money will it take to get him to stop,"" she said.

Fresh off his victory in the Iowa caucuses Monday, Trump had been in court for jury selection Tuesday but left before opening statements to attend a campaign rally in New Hampshire. The juxtaposition of his subdued courtroom appearances and his boisterous campaign events is a harbinger of his year ahead. In addition to the Carroll trial, he also faces four criminal trials and a verdict in a civil fraud trial that could devastate his real estate business while he seeks another term in the White House.

He has denied attacking Carroll and maintains the case is “fiction.”

Habba told the jury in her opening Tuesday that Trump's legal team will show Carroll shouldn't get any damages because the ""evidence will show that Ms. Carroll's reputation was not harmed by President Trump's statements. In fact, it's the exact opposite. She has gained more fame, more notoriety than she could ever have dreamed of.""

""She is looking for you to give her a windfall because some people on social media said mean things about her. But in today's day and age, the internet always has something to say, and it's not always going to be nice,"" Habba added.

""Mr.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8JyB4CHOXcesQK51mzhFqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/92a407246daad5325d905cf974dfc39d,"The judge presiding over E. Jean Carroll's damages trial in New York federal court on Wednesday warned former President Donald Trump that he might bar him from the courtroom for grousing loudly and animatedly to his lawyer during Carroll's testimony about how he repeatedly defamed her.

""Mr. Trump has the right to be present here. That right can be forfeited, and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive and if he disregards court orders,"" U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan told Trump and his attorney after the jury had left the courtroom. ""Mr. Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you are very eager for me to do that,"" the judge said.

""I would love it. I would love it,"" Trump responded.

""I know you would because you just can’t control yourself in this circumstance. You just can't,"" the judge shot back before an exasperated Trump threw his hands in the air.

Trump returned to court after lunch, and posted two attacks against the judge on his social media platform Truth Social at about the same time, calling Kaplan a ""seething and hostile Clinton-appointed Judge."" ""He is abusive, rude, and obviously not impartial but, that’s the way this crooked system works!"" he said in one of the posts.

In another post a short time later, Trump said, Kaplan ""should be sanctioned for his abuse of power — No wonder our Country is going to Hell!""

Trump, who was found liable last year for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll, had appeared visibly upset throughout Carroll's testimony.

“I am here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it he lied and he shattered my reputation,” Carroll, 80, told the jury.

Trump repeatedly shook his head in anger and made comments to his lawyer throughout Carroll's testimony. At one point, Kaplan told Trump's attorney to sit down after denying her objection. Trump slammed the table and commented to his attorney, ""nasty guy,"" apparently referring to the judge.

During the morning break, Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley told the judge that Trump had been loudly making comments, saying some statements were ""false"" and making cracks about Carroll's memory.

Before the jury returned, Kaplan said, ""I’m just going to ask Mr. Trump to take special care to keep his voice down so the jury does not overhear it.”

The request did not take. When the jury broke for lunch, Crowley told the judge that Trump had continued his commentary, and that some jurors could have heard him say ""this really is a con job"" and ""it's a witch hunt.""

That led to the back-and-forth with the judge.

After the parties returned from lunch, one of Trump's attorneys, Michael Madaio, complained to the judge that he had issued his warning to Trump ""without giving us a moment to respond"" to the Carroll team's claim that he was disruptive. Madaio told the judge he had displayed a ""general hostility towards the defense"" and asked him to recuse himself from the case.

""Denied,"" the judge said.

Kaplan also repeatedly chided Trump's lawyer Alina Habba throughout the day for not following his orders and procedure. When she tried reading from a document in the afternoon, the judge told her they were going to take a break and ""during that time you might want to refresh your memory about how it is you get a document into evidence.""

When Carroll first took the stand in the morning she walked past Trump, who was sitting at the defense table, as he looked in a different direction. She testified that Trump has repeatedly told lies about her since 2019, when she first came forward with allegations that he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room in a Manhattan department store in 1996.

She said she'd ""expected him to respond"" to her allegation when she first went public.

""I thought he was going to deny it and say it was consensual, which it was not,"" Carroll said. Instead, Trump said, ""I have never met this woman in my life,"" she said, adding, ""That is a lie.""

""He said I made it up to sell a book, and that is a lie,"" and ""said my false accusations damaged the real victims of assault, and that is a lie,"" Carroll said. She said the then-president declared ""people need to pay dearly,"" and ""I have paid as dearly as possible.""

Trump's statements ""ended the world I had been living in,"" Carroll said, adding that she found herself the target of hateful attacks from his supporters across Twitter and other social media. ""It happened instantaneously,"" she said, with many of her attackers using Trump's words.

""It was so unexpected,"" she said, and the ""messages have never stopped.""

""I receive them all the time, sometimes hundreds a day,"" she added. The jury was shown several of the threats she received, many with graphic threats of violence.

Her lawyer ended her direct examination by showing Trump's Truth Social posts bashing Carroll on Tuesday, while he was in court.

""I want my reputation back,"" Carroll said.

On cross-examination, Habba asked Carroll if she was called a liar online in the five hours between when New York Magazine ran an article with her accusations and Trump's public comments. ""Yes, because the White House denied it"" in the New York article, Carroll said. Asked if she sued the White House over the denial, Carroll said, ""No.""

In opening statements Tuesday, Crowley told the jury Trump “didn’t just deny the assault” when Carroll broke her silence — “he went much, much further,"" Crowley said. ""He said he had no idea who she was. He accused her of lying and making up a story to make money and to advance some political conspiracy against him. And he threatened her. He said she should pay dearly for speaking out against him.""

""Donald Trump was president when he made those statements, and he used the world's biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her and to destroy her reputation,"" she said.

Trump, 77, was found liable last year for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her after he left the White House in a separate civil trial and was hit with a $5 million verdict, which he's appealing. Kaplan used that verdict to find Trump liable for the remarks he made while he was president, as well, so the jury in the current case will be deciding only what amount of damages to award her.

Crowley noted that Trump had continued his attacks since the last verdict, including the posts on Truth Social while he was in court.

""He sat in this courthouse this morning. And while he was sitting there, he posted more defamatory statements, more lies about Ms. Carroll and this case. By our count, by our last count, 22 posts just today. Think about that. Think about that when you consider how much money will it take to get him to stop,"" she said.

Fresh off his victory in the Iowa caucuses Monday, Trump had been in court for jury selection Tuesday but left before opening statements to attend a campaign rally in New Hampshire. The juxtaposition of his subdued courtroom appearances and his boisterous campaign events is a harbinger of his year ahead. In addition to the Carroll trial, he also faces four criminal trials and a verdict in a civil fraud trial that could devastate his real estate business while he seeks another term in the White House.

He has denied attacking Carroll and maintains the case is “fiction.”

Habba told the jury in her opening Tuesday that Trump's legal team will show Carroll shouldn't get any damages because the ""evidence will show that Ms. Carroll's reputation was not harmed by President Trump's statements. In fact, it's the exact opposite. She has gained more fame, more notoriety than she could ever have dreamed of.""

""She is looking for you to give her a windfall because some people on social media said mean things about her. But in today's day and age, the internet always has something to say, and it's not always going to be nice,"" Habba added.

The Democratic-led Senate voted 77-18 on final passage after considering a few amendments. The Republican-led House soon followed suit, passing it by a vote of 314-108.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law before the funding expires Friday at midnight.

It is the third stopgap bill since last September as the divided Congress struggles to agree on full-year government funding bills. Thursday's bill passed with mostly Democratic votes, with 107 Republicans voting for it and 106 voting against it.

A recent deal between Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on how much to spend in the new year has renewed hope of completing the process by the new early March deadlines. But that is far from guaranteed as right-wing House Republicans rebel against it.

The first stopgap bill led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker. His successor, Johnson, is seeking to avoid the same fate by selling the conservative victories in the latest deal.

Before the Senate vote, Schumer inveighed against “a loud contingent of hard-right rabble-rousers who thinks a shutdown is somehow a good thing.""

“In the twisted logic of the hard right, the theory is if enough people feel the pain of a shutdown, the hard-right can bully the rest of Congress into enacting their deeply unpopular agenda,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. “Bullying, intimidation, chaos. This is MAGA extremism in a nutshell.”

Around the same time, the House announced that it would cancel votes on Friday in anticipation of a winter storm and complete votes on the stopgap bill on Thursday.

The bill would extend the two-part government funding deadlines from Jan. 19 to March 1, and from Feb. 2 to March 8. The funding bill is unrelated to negotiations surrounding an immigration and national security supplemental bill that would provide aid to Ukraine and Israel. It's designed to give appropriators more time to craft the 12 appropriations bills that fully fund the government using the newly agreed-to spending levels.

“We need just a little bit more time on the calendar to allow that process to play out,” Johnson told reporters, saying he’s “very hopeful” that Congress can pass all 12 measures.

“We’ll see how this develops. Certainly, we’re not going to have an omnibus,"" he said, referring to the massive, last-minute spending bills Congress has frequently relied on. ""And that was a very important innovation for us to forge forward because it’s no way to run a railroad.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's lawyers urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday to reverse a judicial decision disqualifying the former president from Colorado's Republican primary ballot as the justices prepare to tackle the politically explosive case.

Trump's lawyers in court papers presented the former U.S. president's main arguments against a Colorado Supreme Court Dec. 19 ruling barring him from the primary ballot over his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, citing the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The justices have scheduled oral arguments in the case for Feb. 8.

Trump's lawyers urged the court to ""put a swift and decisive end to these ballot-disqualification efforts,"" noting that similar efforts were underway in more than 30 states.

Trump's lawyers said the 14th Amendment provision does not apply to presidents, that the question of presidential eligibility is reserved to Congress, and that Trump did not participate in an insurrection.

The brief adheres to an accelerated schedule set by the justices on Jan. 5 when they agreed to take up the case. Colorado's Republican primary is set for Mar. 5. Trump is the frontrunner for his party's nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.

The plaintiffs - six conservative Republican or independent voters in Colorado - challenged Trump's eligibility to run for office in light of his actions before the attack. They now have until Jan. 31 to respond to Trump's filing.

The Colorado ruling marked the first time that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment - the so-called disqualification clause - was used to find a presidential candidate ineligible. Section 3 bars from holding office any ""officer of the United States"" who took an oath ""to support the Constitution of the United States"" and then ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

The Colorado lawsuit is part of a wider effort to disqualify Trump from state ballots under the 14th Amendment, so the ruling by the justices may shape the outcome of that drive. For instance, Trump also has appealed to a Maine court a decision by that state's top election official barring him from the primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. That case is on hold until the Supreme Court issues its ruling in the Colorado case.

The 14th Amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the American Civil War of 1861-1865 in which Southern states that allowed the practice of slavery rebelled in a bid for secession.

The Capitol rampage was a bid to prevent Congress from certifying 2020 Biden's election victory over Trump, who gave an incendiary speech to his supporters beforehand, repeating his false claims of widespread voting fraud.

Trump also faces criminal charges in two cases related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election outcome.

The Colorado plaintiffs have emphasized the lower court's findings that Trump's intentional ""mobilizing, inciting, and encouraging"" of an armed mob to attack the Capitol meets the legal definition in Section 3. ""This attack was an 'insurrection' against the Constitution by any standard,"" they said in legal papers.

""His deposition will come after several interviews with Biden family members and associates. We look forward to Hunter Biden's testimony,"" said Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Jim Jordan of Ohio, the committees' respective chairmen.

Both of the committees had approved contempt of Congress resolutions against President Biden's son for previously refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas for closed-door testimony amid the GOP's impeachment inquiry into the president.

The full House had been set to vote to hold him in contempt of Congress this week until Hunter Biden's attorney signaled his willingness to testify.

Republicans have argued that Hunter Biden's testimony is a ""critical component"" of their impeachment investigation as they look into whether the president profited off of his family members' foreign business dealings while he was vice president.

""With the possible exception of President Biden, [Hunter] Biden is the most important witness possessing information about President Biden's involvement in his son's business dealings,"" Republicans said in a report released last week.

Republicans have spent months investigating the president and his son's business dealings but have yet to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing.

Hunter Biden has denied that his father was financially involved in his business dealings.

He has said that he is willing to answer questions from lawmakers but would only do so in a public hearing.

The president's son made a brief surprise appearance at the Oversight Committee's hearing last week, where lawmakers debated the contempt resolution.

""Hunter Biden's willful refusal to comply with the committee's subpoenas is a criminal act,"" Comer said at the hearing. ""It constitutes contempt of Congress and warrants referral to the appropriate United States Attorney's Office for prosecution as prescribed by the law.""

After leaving the meeting, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's attorney, said, ""Republicans have sought to use him as a surrogate to attack his father.""

""And, despite their improper partisan motives, on six occasions — from February to today — we have offered to work with the House committees to see what and how relevant information to any legitimate inquiry could be provided,"" Lowell told reporters.

Kevin Morris, a Hollywood entertainment attorney, gave closed-door testimony Thursday to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees about his friendship with Hunter Biden, which began after the two met at a political fundraiser in 2019. Morris has said he loaned money to Hunter Biden over the years, which Republicans have alleged, without proof, that Morris has leveraged to gain access and influence in the Biden White House.

In a statement to CBS News following Thursday's testimony, Morris defended his actions.

""In addition to legal advice and friendship, over the course of the last four years, I have loaned Hunter money to help him through his difficulties. When needed, we each have had attorneys separately advise us on these transactions. I am confident Hunter will repay these loans. I did not and do not have any expectations of receiving anything from Hunter's father or the Biden administration in exchange for helping Hunter, nor have I asked for anything from President Biden or his administration.

The developments came after a court filing this month by Michael Roman, a co-defendant in the Trump case, alleging Willis was in a ""romantic relationship"" with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

In a filing Thursday, Willis accused Wade's wife Joycelyn Wade of trying to ""harass"" her and ""damage her professional reputation."" She alleged the wife had ""conspired with interested parties in the Criminal Election Interference Case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass and oppress District Attorney Willis.""

Willis also argued that filings in the case appeared to be ""conspicuously coordinated"" with Roman. Willis is seeking a protective order to quash a subpoena for her deposition by Joycelyn Wade. The DA said that the Wades have been living apart since 2021 and have agreed in court filings that their marriage is ""irretrievably broken,"" and that Willis does not have any information ""that might prove relevant to granting or denying the divorce.""

Roman contends that Willis, Nathan Wade and the DA's office should be disqualified from prosecuting the case and the criminal charges against him dismissed “on the grounds that the district attorney and the special prosecutor have been engaged in an improper, clandestine personal relationship during the pendency of this case, which has resulted in the special prosecutor, and, in turn, the district attorney, profiting significantly from this prosecution at the expense of the taxpayers.”

""Instead of handling this case within her office, as she could have done,"" the filing said, Willis ""chose to hire a private special prosecutor to preside over the case,"" and in doing so used the prosecution ""to pay her partner a large sum of money.""

An attorney for Willis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing in the divorce case, which was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, nor did an attorney for Roman.

Joycelyn Wade's lawyer, Andrea Dyer Hastings, said in a statement that her firm is trying ""to help Ms. Wade resolve her divorce fairly and privately, but apparently Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis would prefer to use her public platform. Clearly, this matter is personal for her.""

She said they would respond with their own court filing.

A spokesperson for the DA’s office said this month that they'd respond to Roman's allegations in a court filing and declined further comment.

In his order Thursday setting a hearing date, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee directed the DA’s office to respond to the motion by Feb. 2.

Roman's filing does not provide direct evidence to support the claims, citing only “sources with knowledge” while raising questions about the process by which Willis hired Wade.

Roman's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, has told NBC News that some of the evidence could not be shared until Wade’s divorce records are unsealed.

“At a hearing, the concrete evidence would be presented,” she said.

Roman, a former Trump White House aide and campaign staffer, was one of 19 people charged in the case. He is accused of conspiring to organize “alternate electors” to cast votes for Trump after Joe Biden won the election in the state in 2020.

Four defendants have pleaded guilty in the case, while the others, including Roman and Trump, have pleaded not guilty.

The election comes just eight days after the Iowa Republican party held in-person caucuses, in which former president Donald Trump claimed a major victory over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who came in second and third, respectively.

While Iowa is first in the nation to hold caucuses — which are different from primaries — the Granite State has prided itself for over a century on holding the first official presidential primary. However, primary day in New Hampshire will look a little different this year — starting with the fact that President Biden’s name will not appear on the Democratic party ballot.

Here’s your guide to everything you should know about the 2024 New Hampshire primaries.

What happens on primary day?

New Hampshire will hold two simultaneous elections on Tuesday, Jan. 23: one for the Republican party and the other for the Democratic party, but the latter comes with caveats (more on that later). State law mandates that polls be open for a minimum of eight hours and cannot close later than 8 p.m. ET.

As in every other presidential primary, New Hampshire Republicans will cast their ballots, selecting who they want to choose as the GOP’s nominee for president. There are 22 GOP delegates for the 2024 Republican National Convention up for grabs in the state.

New Hampshire uses a proportional method to allocate delegates to different candidates based on the statewide vote. As long as the candidate receives at least 10% of the statewide vote, they receive delegates. If there are leftover delegates, they are awarded to the candidate that got the most votes in the primary.

There will also be a Democratic primary on Jan. 23 in New Hampshire, but it will be unsanctioned by the Democratic National Committee.

What’s going on with the Democratic primary? And why won’t Biden’s name appear on the ballot?

In an effort to make the primary process more diverse, President Biden urged the DNC to hold the first official Democratic primary of 2024 in South Carolina. (It also doesn’t hurt that Biden won South Carolina’s primary in 2020, while coming in fifth in New Hampshire).

As a result, South Carolina scheduled its Democratic primary for Feb. 3, and the DNC instructed New Hampshire to hold its primary on Feb. 6, the same day as Nevada’s.

But New Hampshire state law says it has to hold its primary one week before any other similar contest. The state’s GOP-led legislature refused to break with tradition to change that law. So, New Hampshire decided to go ahead with an unsanctioned Democratic primary on Jan. 23, while threatening the DNC with legal action.

Biden is prohibited by DNC rules from competing in the New Hampshire primary, which is why his name won’t appear on the ballot, though there are efforts independent of his campaign to get the president’s name added as a write-in.

Because New Hampshire is going against DNC rules, none of the state’s 33 delegates will be awarded based on the results of the primary. This means that whichever Democrat wins the primary won’t actually advance toward the presidential nomination.

Who is on the New Hampshire ballot this year?

To get on a primary ballot in New Hampshire, candidates are required only to fill out a form and pay $1,000. This means voters will have their pick of a long list of candidates, including characters like perennial Libertarian candidate Vermin Supreme, best known for wearing a boot on his head.

Republican voters will select from among 25 candidates, including Trump, DeSantis and Haley. GOP candidates who have since dropped out of the race — such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson — will also appear on the Republican ballot, but they cannot be awarded delegates.

And while Democrats will not be able to vote for Biden, they’ll get to choose from a list of 21 other candidates, including self-help author Marianne Williamson and Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips.

What is the point of delegates, anyway?

In the primary process, a candidate needs delegates in order to advance to the next stage in the race for the White House, which is the general election in November.

A candidate who performs well in caucuses and primaries receives delegates. The more delegates a candidate is awarded, the closer they are to receiving the minimum number required to receive their party’s presidential nomination at their respective national conventions this summer. A GOP candidate needs 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates. The Democratic candidate needs 1,969 of 3,936 delegates.

The candidate who receives their party’s presidential nomination goes on to compete in the general election in November, the winner of which will ultimately become the next president of the United States.

Who can vote in the New Hampshire primary?

Only registered voters can participate, but first-time voters can register to vote the day of the primary. New Hampshire voters can also participate by absentee ballot for valid reasons, but the ballots must be turned in by Jan. 23.

Students attending college in New Hampshire from other states can also participate in the primary, as long as they don’t also vote in their home state.

The primary is considered open, which means voters cast ballots for the party they’re registered with, while undeclared voters can participate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. The deadline to switch party affiliations before the primary was Oct. 6, 2023.

Once an undeclared voter casts a ballot for a particular party, they will automatically become a registered member of that party unless they fill out a card or sign a list to return to undeclared status before leaving the polling place.

Federal prosecutors said in a court filing Thursday that Navarro “deserves severe punishment” that includes a $200,000 fine in addition to prison time. He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan 25.

Navarro, 74, was found guilty last year on two counts of contempt after he rejected a congressional subpoena to testify before the now-defunct Jan. 6 committee and provide relevant documents.

""The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law,"" prosecutors wrote in Thursday's sentencing memo.

“He cloaked his bad-faith strategy of defiance and contempt behind baseless, unfounded invocations of executive privilege and immunity that could not and would never apply to his situation,” they added.

Lawyers for Navarro did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Justice Department's sentencing request.

Navarro has said that he ignored the congressional subpoena because Trump told him to invoke executive privilege, an argument that was later rejected by prosecutors and a judge.

In a separate court filing Thursday, Navarro's attorneys asked that the court not sentence him to more than six months in prison and to pay a $200 fine.

""Despite the government’s effort to label Dr. Navarro as an insurrectionist, the reality is that his conviction arises solely from a conviction for his refusal to comply with the Select Committee’s subpoena and has nothing to do with the events that occurred at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,"" Navarro's lawyers wrote in their filing.

Navarro isn't the first former Trump adviser to face the possibility of imprisonment after defying a Jan. 6 committee subpoena. In 2022, Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months behind bars plus a $6,500 fine — prosecutors had sought six months in prison and a $200,000 fine.

Bannon has appealed his conviction, and a federal judge suspended his sentence during the appeal process.

Prosecutors drew comparisons to Bannon in their sentencing memo for Navarro.

""Like Stephen Bannon before him, throughout the pendency of this case, the Defendant has exploited his notoriety — through courthouse press conferences, his books, and through podcasts—to display to the public the reason for his failure to comply with the Committee’s subpoena: a disregard for government processes and the law, and in particular, the work of the Committee,"" prosecutors wrote.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers sent a letter to Austin on Thursday requesting his presence at a Feb. 14 hearing that will focus on how the Defense Department waited three days to tell White House officials that the Pentagon chief was in the intensive care unit. Rogers, R-Ala., launched a formal inquiry into the matter this month.

""Maintaining the most ready and lethal force possible requires that everyone in the national security community be able to rely upon the Secretary of Defense’s availability and transparency,"" said Rogers in a four-page letter to Austin. ""Regrettably, you have not exhibited these attributes throughout this most recent string of events.""

Rogers said he wants Austin to provide details about his communications with the White House and Defense Department officials, the temporary transfer of power to Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks and Austin's official actions during his hospitalization.

""I expect your full honesty and cooperation in this matter,"" Rogers said. ""Anything short of that is completely unacceptable.""

A Defense Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.

Austin was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday after being admitted there on Jan. 1 with complications related to treatment for prostate cancer.

The 70-year-old defense secretary has faced intense scrutiny over his delay in notifying the White House about the hospitalization.

Austin has said he takes ""full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure.""

""I also understand the media concerns about transparency and I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed,"" Austin said in a Jan. 6 statement. ""I commit to doing better.""

Trump’s lawyers filed a brief laying out his position ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Feb. 8.

The Colorado Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 19 that a clause in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment that prohibits “an officer of the United States” who “engaged in insurrection” from running for various federal offices applied to Trump.

The case raises various previously undecided legal questions, including whether the constitutional language applies to those running for president and who gets to decide whether someone engaged in insurrection.

In Thursday’s filing, Trump’s lawyers touched upon those themes, saying that a president is not an “officer of the United States,” that Trump did not “engage in insurrection” and that only Congress can enforce the provision in question.

“The court should put a swift and decisive end to these ballot-disqualification efforts, which threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and which promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado’s lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.

The state high court’s decision reversed a lower court’s ruling in which a judge said that Trump had engaged in insurrection by inciting the riot on Jan. 6 but that presidents are not subject to the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment because they are not an “officer of the United States.”

The state court said its ruling would remain on hold indefinitely once Trump appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Interest in the Colorado case was heightened when Maine’s top election official concluded that Trump was ineligible to appear on the Republican primary ballot in that state, too. That case was put on hold, meaning Trump remains on the ballot for now, and Trump’s appeal has also been stayed pending resolution of the Supreme Court case.

The high court’s ruling could have ramifications in all 50 states, a point made on Thursday by Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief stressing the need for a definitive decision on the issue. She mentioned that a similar challenge was filed in Michigan and although it failed in relation to the Republican primary, it could be revived for the general election in November.

“These questions must be fully answered now because election officials, like the Secretary, need to know whether the former president is eligible to appear on the ballot as a candidate, and voters deserve to know whether he is eligible to hold the office of president before casting their votes,” Benson’s lawyers wrote. Benson did not take a position on whether Trump should be deemed ineligible.

Dozens of other briefs have been filed in the case so far, including one backing Trump submitted by 179 Republican members of Congress led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Trump discussed the Supreme Court case during an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News.

“We put on three great justices, and you have some other great justices up there, and they’re not going to take the vote away from the people,” Trump said in an interview with Sean Hannity.

Trump nominated Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The initial lawsuit was filed on behalf of six Colorado voters by the left-leaning government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and two law firms. They and their supporters have a Jan. 31 deadline to file their own briefs to the Supreme Court.

But neither side expects dramatic progress from Friday’s discussions. The talks, to be attended by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, White House homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alicia Bárcena, are an extension of discussions that began in Mexico on Dec. 27, when U.S. officials flew to Mexico amid historic highs in illegal border crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.

After those conversations, Mexico began deportations of Venezuelans, a top nationality crossing into the U.S., and began interdicting more migrants crossing into Mexico from Guatemala. Those moves, as well as seasonal migration patterns, produced a dramatic plunge in the number of migrants crossing the border at the beginning of the year.

But U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the talks say not to expect deliverables from Friday’s meeting. A senior U.S. administration official who spoke to reporters on Thursday said, “We don’t expect any big announcements tomorrow.” Another senior U.S. official said there will be many more discussions over the next year.

The two sides have laid out clear objectives for what they want out of negotiations going forward, according to sources who spoke to NBC News earlier this month.

Among the priorities for Mexico is getting the U.S. to agree to committing large figures to combat migration by “addressing root causes,” meaning political corruption, violence and poverty in Western Hemisphere countries. A third senior U.S. administration official said Thursday the United States is interested in working with Mexico to address root causes.

Earlier this month, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador publicly called on the U.S. to deploy $20 billion in aid to Latin America and Caribbean countries and to suspend the sanctions on Venezuela, among other requests. At the time, a U.S official said López Obrador had an “ambitious agenda.”

Both U.S. and Mexican officials have emphasized that their ongoing negotiations are not transactional. For example, Mexico would not stop helping the U.S. with immigration if it doesn’t commit to spending $20 billion in the region. Two people familiar with the negotiations said Mexico has its own interest in curbing illegal migration because the flow of northbound migrants affects Mexico as well.

The U.S. is highly dependent on Mexico’s willingness to help, however. As talks continue in Washington this week and throughout the year, Mexico holds a significant amount of leverage.

“Hunter Biden will appear before our committees for a deposition on February 28, 2024. His deposition will come after several interviews with Biden family members and associates,” said Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan in a statement. “We look forward to Hunter Biden’s testimony.”

Comer, R-Ky., serves as the chairman of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, while Jordan, R-Ohio, is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

The two Republicans added that their committees are working with the attorney for the president’s brother James Biden to schedule his appearance as well.

The committees are scheduled to hear from business associates of members of the Biden family later this month and into February.

The White House referred NBC News to Hunter Biden’s representatives when reached for comment.

A source familiar with the discussion between staff on the Oversight and Judiciary committees and Hunter Biden’s attorneys confirmed the Republicans’ statement without explicitly saying that Biden would attend the deposition.

“His team has been in discussion with Committee staff regarding a way for Hunter to provide the facts in a way that addresses his concern,” the source said in an email, reiterating Hunter Biden's willingness to testify publicly.

“His concern has always been a pattern by Republicans to cherry-pick closed-door sessions,” the source added.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said he’s looking forward to Feb. 28 and “getting through with this thing.”

“More and more Republicans are telling me, especially now that their margin is vanishing to almost nothing, that they just don’t have the votes for impeachment,” said Raskin. “And so they have to try to keep the Hunter Biden thing going. The Hunter Biden thing is a distraction from the fact that you have a dozen or so Republicans who just won’t vote to impeach Joe Biden because they’re in divided districts.”

The president’s son had previously said he would be willing to testify at an initial public hearing, an offer Republicans had shot down, arguing they wanted him to appear for a closed-door deposition first. Hunter Biden defied the subpoena for closed-door testimony, instead appearing outside the Capitol for a press conference in December.

“I’m here today to make sure that the House committee’s illegitimate investigations of my family did not proceed on distortions, manipulated evidence, and lies,” he said last month to reporters.

House Republicans this week paused efforts to push for a resolution to hold President Joe Biden’s son in contempt of Congress as Hunter Biden's lawyers and the committees began talking about scheduling testimony. GOP lawmakers on Sunday said that they would issue new subpoenas for Hunter Biden.

Comer told NBC News on Thursday that he “absolutely” believed it was the contempt process that persuaded Hunter Biden to come in.

The reversal from Hunter Biden comes as he faced the credible threat of a House vote to hold him in contempt of Congress. Two Republican-led committees had approved that vote and it was expected to pass on the House floor. Had it passed, it would be referred to a U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C. to decide whether to prosecute Hunter Biden.

Comer also said he is still committed to letting Hunter Biden testify at a public hearing after a closed-door deposition and promised to release a transcript of the deposition “quickly” after it happens. He predicted the deposition would last about eight hours.

The GOP-controlled House voted in December to authorize its impeachment inquiry into the president over his family’s business dealings, though Republicans have not produced concrete evidence that the president committed wrongdoing or peddled his influence.

“It’s clear that the Republicans know they’ve not laid a glove on Joe Biden,” Raskin said, adding that Republicans “figure that Hunter Biden has had his name dragged through the mud enough that he’s unpopular, so they can go after him.”

(AP) — Seven Republicans vying for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Nevada circled the familiar talking points of GOP politics at a debate on Thursday, while also taking shots at the front runner who made an apparently strategic decision not to attend.

The debate in a Reno casino ballroom focused on increased border security, anti-abortion stances and cutting government spending and size, but candidates also criticized retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, whose backing in Washington, D.C., and formidable 2022 campaign have made him a fundraising juggernaut above the crowded primary field.

Nearly every candidate called out Brown for his absence and described him as an establishment candidate not willing to face voters, a combative signal by a group of lesser-known Republicans attempting to gain ground in an otherwise cordial debate.

“Don’t vote for Sam Brown. Look at one of these candidates up here,” said Bill Conrad, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and former deputy mayor of Modesto, California, who co-founded Redmove, the conservative group hosting the debate.

Brown’s campaign said the decision to skip the debate reflected his comfortable lead in resources and grassroots support. The non-engagement strategy has been employed by other campaign front-runners, most notably by former President Donald Trump.

“The numbers say it all: Sam Brown is the only candidate in this race with the resources, support and grassroots energy to take on Jacky Rosen,” Brown’s campaign said in a statement. “Nevada Republicans are uniting behind Donald Trump and Sam Brown because they are the only conservative champions who can defeat Biden and Rosen in November.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter also was not on stage after backing out at the last minute, which his campaign did not explain in a statement following the debate.

“I will debate Scam Brown at any time,” Gunter said in the statement, employing a nickname he often uses to disparage Brown.

The other candidates on stage included Jim Marchant, a former candidate for Nevada secretary of state and outspoken election denier; Tony Grady, an Air Force veteran and former candidate for lieutenant governor; Stephanie Phillips, a real estate broker; and Ronda Kennedy, an attorney.

Former President Donald Trump has skipped all Republican primary debates in the current presidential campaign, electing to hold rallies or appear on rival television networks in a strategy that has deprived the events of viewership and media attention while he remains the dominant front-runner. The last GOP primary debate between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley drew fewer than 2.6 million viewers.

Brown, a Purple Heart recipient, was a heavily recruited candidate for Republicans in Washington looking to avoid a repeat of their lackluster showing in the 2022 midterm elections, when flawed GOP candidates helped Democrats win battleground races and hold the Senate majority.

Two years ago, Brown was a longshot Senate candidate who criticized Republican front-runner Adam Laxalt for agreeing only to a pre-recorded debate instead of a live, prime-time broadcast.

“He must feel safe at 8 a.m., on a Monday morning, in a closed studio, where working class Nevadans can’t challenge him,” Brown said of the former Nevada Attorney General, who enjoyed the backing of the Republican Party’s most influential figures, from former President Donald Trump to then-Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.

Laxalt won that primary handily but lost narrowly in the general election to incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto.

This cycle, Brown often has brushed past questions about his primary opponents to focus attacks on incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen. He said the crowded field was a product of Rosen’s leadership, not his.

But on Thursday, Rosen was seldom mentioned as Brown weathered attacks from his opponents.

“I hope you remember the one that’s not here,” Kennedy said.

Last year’s tally marked an increase from a figure released for 2022, but it's below the 9,625 cases the agency investigated in 2021 when the Jan. 6 riot occurred. Figures in recent years have remained largely elevated when contrasted with the 5,206 cases Capitol Police investigated just five years ago in 2018.

In Thursday's release, Capitol Police said that ""a wide range of threats and concerning statements"" had been directed at lawmakers from both political parties through various modes of communication including phone, social media, email, and others.

With the upcoming campaign season, the department is expecting 2024 to be ""a very busy year for our special agents,"" USCP Assistant Chief of Protective and Intelligence Operations Ashan M. Benedict said in a statement.

“Our team is dedicated to putting all of our resources into protecting the Congress while we continue to grow in order to keep up with our expanding mission,"" Benedict said.

In August last year, Capitol Police announced fresh efforts to shore up its recruitment of agents and investigators to protect members of Congress amid a wave of threats to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

A Nevada man was arrested and charged in October with leaving a series of antisemitic, profanity-laced voicemails at the office of Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., a prominent Jewish voice in support of Israel after Hamas’ attacks there.

That same month, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, said she received death threats and threatening phone calls after she cast her vote in a round of balloting for House speaker.

Earlier last year, a man was accused of attacking Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota in a Washington, D.C., elevator. He was sentenced in November to 27 months in prison.

E. Jean Carroll defamation

Expert: Repairing damage to E. Jean Carroll’s reputation would cost up to $12.1 million

Key players: U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll, Trump lawyer Alina Habba, Northwestern University marketing professor Ashlee Humphreys

On Thursday, Carroll’s lawyers called Humphreys to testify about the amount of money it would cost Carroll to repair the damage to her reputation caused by Trump’s attacks, the New York Daily News reported.

Using an analysis of Trump’s reach on social media platforms and the media coverage of his denials that he had sexually assaulted Carroll in 1996, Humphreys estimated that Trump’s claims had resulted in up to 104.1 million audience impressions. Undoing the resulting damage to Carroll’s reputation would, therefore, cost between $7.2 and $12.1 million, she testified.

The damage “was severe to her reputation as a journalist, and the costs to repair it are considerable,” Humphreys testified.

Trump’s lawyers argued that the former president’s remarks in the case had not been the cause of death threats Carroll received following the release of her memoir detailing Trump’s assault.

Carroll is suing Trump for $10 million in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount in punitive damages relating to the fact that Trump has continued to regularly defame her since the release of her 2019 memoir detailing her rape claims.

Prior to Humphreys taking the stand, Carroll faced cross examination from Habba, who tried to chip away at Carroll’s claim that Trump’s verbal attacks on her credibility had harmed her reputation and ability to make a living.

""No, my status was lowered,” Carroll testified. “I’m partaking in this trial to bring my old reputation and status back.”

She also told the jury that while she made as much as $400,000 a year as a journalist in the 1990s, and $60,000 a year in 2019 as a columnist for Elle magazine, she now earns roughly $100,000 a year from her posts on Substack.

Habba asked Carroll whether she was more “well-known” following Trump’s denials that he had assaulted Carroll than before, implying that notoriety had benefited her career.

""Yes, but I am hated by a lot more people,"" Carroll replied.

Trump, who clashed with Kaplan a day earlier, was not in the New York courtroom Thursday. Instead, he attended the funeral of his mother-in-law in Florida.

But jurors did hear from the former president Thursday. Carroll’s lawyers played a video clip of Trump addressing cameras yesterday in lower Manhattan, where he repeated his claims that he “never knew” Carroll and that her account about being assaulted in the changing room was “a made-up fabricated story.”

Trump is expected to testify in the case on Monday.

Why it matters: The case will decide how much more money Trump will be required to pay Carroll, if any. Because a jury has already found Trump liable for having sexually assaulted Carroll and ordered him to pay $5 million for defamatory comments made about her in 2022, he could soon find himself hit with a very costly verdict in the second trial.

Trump’s lawyers file Supreme Court brief on Colorado ballot ban

Key players: U.S. Supreme Court, Colorado Supreme Court

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers submitted a brief with the high court seeking a reversal of a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to ban Trump from state primary ballots on the grounds that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment bars him from holding office again, Reuters reported.

Section 3 states that no person who has “previously taken an oath” of office such as “an officer of the United States” who later “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” is allowed to hold office again.

“The Court should reverse the Colorado decision because President Trump is not even subject to section 3, as the President is not an ‘officer of the United States’ under the Constitution,” the brief filed Thursday states.

The brief continues: “And even if President Trump were subject to section 3 he did not ‘engage in’ anything that qualifies as ‘insurrection.’”

But a lower court judge in Colorado concluded the opposite.

Colorado’s Republican primary will be held on March 5.

The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Feb. 8.

On Thursday, more than 40 U.S. senators signed a brief to the Supreme Court asking it to keep Trump on state ballots in the face of 14th Amendment challenges.

Why it matters: The Supreme Court’s ultimate decision will impact rulings by the Colorado Supreme Court and Maine’s secretary of state on whether the Constitution bars Trump from holding office again.

Judge Lewis Kaplan warns former President Donald Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom if he continues to loudly comment on the testimony being given by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The rebuke comes after the judge in the second civil defamation lawsuit brought by Carroll had instructed Trump’s lawyers to have their client “keep his voice down” while Carroll testified. Trump, who is in court in New York Wednesday watching Carroll on the witness stand, could be heard commenting on her answers. Here are the latest legal developments surrounding the former president looking to be reelected to the White House in 2024.

E. Jean Carroll defamation

Judge warns Trump he can be tossed from courtroom

Key players: Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll, Trump lawyers Alina Habba and Michael Madaio, Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley

In a terse exchange Wednesday following a request by Kaplan to have Trump keep his voice down as Carroll testifies, the judge warned Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom.

“Mr. Trump has the right to be present here,” Kaplan said following another complaint by Crowley. “That right can be forfeited and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive, which what has been reported to me consists of. And if he disregards court orders, Mr. Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial.”

“I understand you’re probably eager for me to do that,” Kaplan added.

“I would love it,” Trump responded to the judge, according to court reporters.

Kaplan then replied: “I know you would. You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance apparently.”

Earlier, after Crowley complained that Trump could be heard “loudly saying things that are false” during Carroll’s testimony Wednesday in the second civil defamation trial against him, the judge addressed Trump’s lawyers, the Associated Press reported.

“I’m just going to ask Mr. Trump to take special care to keep his voice down when he’s conferring with counsel so that the jury does not overhear it,” Kaplan told Habba and Madaio.

As Carroll recounted for the jury how Trump “shattered” her reputation by repeatedly denying her allegation that Trump had raped her in the changing room of a New York department store in 1996, Trump was heard saying, “It’s false,” and other comments.

“I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and shattered my reputation,” Carroll testified.

“He lied last month. He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday. And I am here to get my reputation back,” Carroll added.

In May, a jury found that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll and later defamed her in 2022 by denying her account of the encounter that appeared in a memoir published in 2019. They awarded Carroll $5 million in damages.

The second trial concerns a statement issued by Trump in 2019, when he was president, alleging that Carroll made up the story to “sell a new book.”

Carroll testified that Trump’s statement set off a frenzy among his supporters that resulted in her receiving numerous death threats.

Carroll, whose lawyers noted in their opening statement that Trump continues to defame their client, is seeking an additional $10 million in compensatory damages, as well as millions more in punitive damages.

Why it matters: Kaplan has shown little patience with Trump’s courtroom theatrics nor his lawyers’ attempts to dismiss or delay the trial. The case is likely to wrap up early next week and may well prove very expensive for Trump.

In her opening statement Tuesday, E. Jean Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley tells the jury in former President Donald Trump’s second defamation trial that he “unleashed his followers to go after her” by continually denying her claim that he raped her in a department store changing room in the 1990s. Judge Lewis Kaplan tells prospective jurors “it has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll.” Here are the latest legal developments surrounding the former president who is seeking to be reelected to the White House in 2024.

E. Jean Carroll defamation

Trump ‘unleashed his followers to go after’ Carroll, her lawyer tells jury

Key players: Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll, Carroll attorney Shawn Crowley, Trump lawyer Alina Habba

In her opening statement Tuesday in the second civil defamation lawsuit brought against Trump, Crowley said the former president had “unleashed his followers to go after” Carroll “to threaten her life.”

“Donald Trump was president when he made those statements, and he used the world’s biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, humiliate her and to destroy her reputation,” Crowley told the jury in the case that will decide how much more money, if any, Trump will owe Carroll.

Crowley noted that even as Trump sat in the courtroom earlier in the day, defamatory messages continued to be posted to his social media account.

""How much money will it take to make him stop?"" Crowley asked the jury. ""He kept up those very same lies even after a federal jury sat in this courtroom and unanimously found that he sexually assaulted her and defamed her.""

On his Truth Social account Tueday morning, messages attributed to Trump called Carroll’s allegation that he raped her in a department store changing room in the mid-1990s “fabricated” and “attempted extortion,” the Associated Press reported.

Habba has said that the evidence in the case will show that Trump did not ruin Carroll’s reputation, and that she continued to find career success following the alleged attack.

Carroll, who in May was awarded $5 million by a jury, is seeking another $10 million in compensatory damages as well as millions more in punitive damages for defamatory remarks Trump made about Carroll in 2019, when he was president.

Trump left the courtroom Tuesday prior to opening statements. The judge has agreed to allow him to testify on Monday in the case, even though arguments are expected to conclude this week.

Why it matters: Because a jury already found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed Carroll, his continued assertions that she lied about the attack in a department store changing room open him up to further legal action.

Judge: ‘It has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll’

Key players: Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll

With Trump looking on during jury selection on Tuesday, Kaplan informed the prospective jurors in the civil lawsuit that the case before them would not revisit the question of whether Trump sexually assaulted Carroll in the mid-1990s in the changing room of a New York department store, ABC News reported.

“The court determined in a previous decision that Mr. Trump is liable for defamation,” Kaplan said. “For purposes of this trial it has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll, that he knew when he made these statements about Ms. Carroll ... that they were false or with reckless disregard.”

In May, a Manhattan jury ruled that Trump had assaulted Carroll and then defamed her in 2022 by claiming that the incident never happened

“This woman is not my type!” Trump wrote in a social media post calling Carroll’s claims “a hoax and a lie.”

The jury sided with Carroll and awarded her $5 million in damages.

The new case will determine whether comments Trump made in 2019, when he was president, also constituted defamation.

“She is trying to sell a new book — that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section. Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,” Trump said in the 2019 statement about Carroll’s account of the assault.

Kaplan also assured the jury pool that their identities would not be made public.

“Neither your names nor the names of the jurors who are ultimately selected nor any other identifying information will be made public,” Kaplan said.

Why it matters: With the earlier court decision, the question before the second jury is much more simple to decide. Kaplan has indicated that the trial could be over in a week’s time. Should the jury rule against Trump a second time, he could owe Carroll millions more in damages.

Adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, tells her podcast audience that she is “set to testify” in former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York in March. Trump is charged with 34 felonies in the case and has pleaded not guilty. Here are the latest legal developments for the Republican who hopes to be reelected to the White House in 2024.

New York hush money

Stormy Daniels declares she is ‘set to testify’ in Trump hush money trial

Key players: Adult film star Stormy Daniels, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen

On Sunday, Daniels said on her podcast that she was “set to testify” in Trump’s hush money trial in New York that begins on March 25, CBS News reported.

""Obviously, things have been next-level crazy, since I am set to testify in, at this point in time, March — obviously, that can change at any moment — in the hush money case,"" Daniels said on the podcast.

Two civil cases against Trump have already been heard since he left the White House, and jury selection for a third will begin on Tuesday. The hush money trial is the first of four criminal cases that could be heard during the Republican presidential primary.

In March 2023, Trump made history by becoming the first former president to be indicted on criminal charges. He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to hide a payment to Daniels in 2016 for $130,000 that Daniels alleges was made to cover up an alleged extramarital affair that took place in 2006.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and denies that he ever had the affair with Daniels.

Daniels has detailed having sex with Trump in 2006 in a memoir titled Full Disclosure and in media interviews.

Cohen, who testified before the Manhattan grand jury about making the $130,000 payment to Daniels on Trump’s behalf, will also testify in the case.

Why it matters: Daniels will certainly be asked on the witness stand to revisit the details of the alleged affair with Trump. As this is a criminal trial, Trump will be required to be present for that testimony.

In a written filing, Trump's lawyers called on the court to reverse a first-of-its-kind Colorado Supreme Court decision that said Trump should not be on the state's Republican primary ballot because of his role in the events that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The justices are hearing arguments Feb. 8 in a case that both sides say needs to be resolved quickly so that voters know whether Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, is eligible to hold the presidency.

The court is dealing with the dispute under a compressed timeframe that could produce a decision before Super Tuesday on March 5, when the largest number of delegates are up for grabs in a single day, including in Colorado.

The case presents the high court with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some people who “engaged in insurrection” from holding public office. The amendment was adopted in 1868, following the Civil War.

Efforts to keep Trump off the ballot “threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and ... promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado’s lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots,” Trump's lawyers wrote.

Trump should win on many grounds, they wrote, including that he has not engaged in insurrection. “In fact, the opposite is true, as President Trump repeatedly called for peace, patriotism, and law and order,” the lawyers wrote.

The Colorado court noted that Trump had held a rally outside the White House and exhorted his supporters to “fight like hell” before they walked to the Capitol.

Trump's Supreme Court team is led by Texas-based lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, who devised aspects of the anti-abortion legislation that largely shut down abortions in Texas months before the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022.

Republican members of Congress, attorneys general and Republican legislative leaders in 27 states, and three former U.S. attorneys general, including one who served Trump, are among those who have weighed in to back him in the Colorado case.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Mike Johnson are among nearly 180 Republicans in Congress who have warned that a ruling upholding Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot would inevitably lead to tit-for-tat disqualifications of political opponents.

Colorado’s Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled last month that Trump should not be on the Republican primary ballot.

A two-sentence provision in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that anyone who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection” against it is no longer eligible for state or federal office. After Congress passed an amnesty for most of the former confederates the measure targeted in 1872, the provision fell into disuse until dozens of suits were filed to keep Trump off the ballot this year. Only the one in Colorado was successful.

Trump is separately appealing to state court a ruling by Maine’s Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, that he is ineligible to appear on that state’s ballot over his role in the Capitol attack. Both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Maine secretary of state’s rulings are on hold until the appeals play out.

The high court’s decision to intervene, which both sides have called for, is the most direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore in 2000, when a conservative majority effectively decided the election for Republican George W. Bush. Only Justice Clarence Thomas remains from that court.

Three of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Trump, though they have repeatedly ruled against him in 2020 election-related lawsuits, as well as on his efforts to keep documents related to Jan. 6 and his tax returns from being turned over to congressional committees.

The issue of whether Trump can be on the ballot is not the only matter related to the former president or Jan. 6 that has reached the high court. The justices last month declined a request from special counsel Jack Smith to swiftly take up and rule on Trump’s claims that he is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, though the issue could be back before the court soon depending on the ruling of a Washington-based appeals court.

And the court has said that it intends to hear an appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot, including against Trump.

Rios' sentence is consistent with others for similar offenses, said criminal defense attorney Mark Friese, a long-time practitioner in DUI cases. He noted that Rios' driving privileges will be suspended automatically for 91 days.

“It does not appear that he was treated more harshly than other people in similar situations,"" Friese said. “My guess is that the judge recognizes ... there are multiple entities here that are going to hold Mr. Rios to account.”

Police body-camera footage from the Dec. 15 traffic stop, requested by and provided to the AP, shows Rios cursing an officer, repeatedly questioning his English accent, and using homophobic slurs and anti-migrant language. He also said he would call the North Dakota attorney general about the situation. He told the officers they would “regret picking on me because you don’t know who ... I am.”

He has faced growing calls from his party to resign, including the House majority leader and state and local Republican Party officials.

Last week, Republican House Majority Leader Mike Lefor removed him from the Legislature's interim Judiciary Committee, saying it wouldn't be fair for law enforcement officers to testify in front of a committee of which Rios is a member. The House-Senate panel meets between legislative sessions for studies of topics related to law enforcement and the legal system for future or potential legislation.

Rios has said he is “seriously mulling all aspects” of his future, and plans to seek help for alcoholism, but he has made no plans to resign. He also previously said he takes responsibility for his “disgusting actions,"" and apologized “to those I have hurt and disappointed,"" including law enforcement officers.

Rios has said he was leaving a Christmas party before police pulled him over.

Rios, who works in an oil field position involved in the hydraulic fracturing of wells, was elected unopposed in 2022 to a four-year term in the state House of Representatives. Republicans control the House, 82-12.

US Navy ships spent months intercepting the Houthi attacks and warning them to stop to no avail.

Biden said that while the strikes on the militant group haven't deterred them, they will continue.

US forces operating near Yemen aren't waiting to respond to Houthi threats anymore and are hitting them before they are even launched, a new tactic aimed at putting greater pressure on the group.

The US previously spent months simply intercepting missiles and drones without a direct kinetic response against the Houthis. That changed last Thursday, but the shift doesn't appear to be deterring the Iranian-backed militant group.

On Thursday, reporters asked President Joe Biden if the strikes against Houthis are working.

""Well, when you say 'working,' are they stopping the Houthis? No,"" he said, referring to the strikes. ""Are they going to continue? Yes.""

President Biden says the United States will continue to conduct airstrikes against Ansar Allah (Houthis).

Since the US, in a coordinated multinational response with its allies and partners, launched a massive retaliatory strike on the Houthis directly last week as punishment for dozens of attacks on international shipping, US forces are now regularly targeting Houthi missiles on the ground directly rather than waiting around for the militant group to launch them.

On Thursday, US Central Command said it had ""conducted strikes on two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the South Red Sea and were prepared to launch.""

US forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and ""determined they were an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region,"" the press release read.

The previous day, a similar situation unfolded. CENTCOM said that it ""conducted strikes on 14 Iran-backed Houthi missiles that were loaded to be fired in Houthi controlled areas in Yemen.""

""These missiles on launch rails presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time, prompting US forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves,"" Wednesday's press release added.

And the day before that, CENTCOM said that American forces ""struck and destroyed four Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles"" that were ""prepared to launch from Houthi-controlled areas.""

In all of these cases, the US moved proactively, degrading Houthi forces, now redesignated as terrorists, by prioritizing striking first to neutralize missiles before they were launched.

Regardless of how this plays out, it's a notable shift for the US from how it and its allies have been handling the Houthis over the past few months.

Houthis' attacks, which began in direct response to the Israel-Hamas war but escalated, have forced global shipping operations to reroute vessels, driving up cost and time.

The US, which had already been intercepting threats, took steps in mid-December to restore navigation in the area through coalition action, but Houthi attacks continued. By early January, the US and more than a dozen allies issued a statement condemning the Houthis and demanding an immediate end to their attacks.

The statement said that ""the Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways.""

Shortly after, the Houthis launched their largest-ever attack, which CENTCOM said included 18 one-way attack drones, two anti-ship cruise missiles, and one anti-ship ballistic missile.

Western officials continued to warn against the attacks until last Thursday, when the US and UK conducted widespread attacks targeting dozens of Houthi assets across Yemen, including radar stations, weapons storage, launch sites, command, and production facilities.

Since last week, the US has conducted five direct strikes on the Houthis. And as Biden said, the strikes are expected to continue. A Pentagon spokesperson told media this afternoon that it's up to the Houthis when this ends.

The House Oversight Committee announced Thursday that the two parties have agreed for Hunter Biden to sit for a deposition on Feb. 28.

“The president’s son is a key witness in this investigation and he’s gonna be able to come in now and sit down and answer questions in a substantive, orderly manner,” Rep. James Comer, chair of the Oversight Committee, told reporters. He added that Hunter Biden will be able to testify publicly sometime after his deposition.

News of the agreement was confirmed by Hunter Biden's legal team Thursday night.

Republicans had been set to advance a contempt resolution against him to the House floor this week but called it off Tuesday to give the attorneys additional time to negotiate. If they had voted on the contempt resolution, the referral would have been sent to the Justice Department where the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia would have had to decide whether to prosecute Hunter Biden.

The agreement concludes months of contentious back-and-forth between President Joe Biden's son and Republicans who have been investigating his overseas business dealings for over a year in a so far futile effort to connect it to his father.

Republicans, led by Comer and Jordan, first subpoenaed the younger Biden in November, demanding that he appear before lawmakers in a private setting by mid-December. Biden and his attorneys refused to comply with the private interview, saying that it would allow information to be selectively leaked and manipulated by House Republicans and insisted that he would only testify in a public setting.

When Republicans denied those terms, Hunter Biden and his attorneys made two separate appearances at the U.S. Capitol, further angering congressional investigators. In both instances, Biden again refused to testify privately, instead delivering statements to the press where he defended his business affairs and castigated the yearslong investigations into him and his family.

“There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business because it did not happen,” the president’s son said in remarks outside the Capitol in December.

He added, “There is no fairness or decency in what these Republicans are doing — they have lied over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life — so much so that their lies have become the false facts believed by too many people.

But Hunter Biden and his legal team appeared to shift gears late last week when they sent a letter to Comer and Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, indicating a willingness for the first time to come in for a private deposition.

Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's attorney, wrote in a letter Friday that his client's cooperation is dependent on the committee issuing a new subpoena, which they will now do given the updated deposition date. They had argued that the two subpoenas sent in last year were not legitimate because they were issued before the full House authorized the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

The impeachment inquiry into the president, which began in September, has focused heavily on Hunter Biden and his international business affairs, questioning whether the president profited from that work. It has so far failed to uncover evidence directly implicating Joe Biden in wrongdoing involving his son’s work.

Meanwhile, Hunter Biden is currently facing criminal charges in two states from the special counsel investigation. He’s charged with firearm counts in Delaware, alleging he broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. Special counsel David Weiss filed additional charges last month, alleging he failed to pay about $1.4 million in taxes over three years.

He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.

In one of several interviews with POLITICO, Steve Garvey, a former professional baseball player and first-time political candidate, wouldn’t even rule out voting for President Joe Biden as he sought to distance himself from Trump.

“Nobody’s out of bounds because I’m looking at each individual soul separately,” Garvey said when asked who he was considering supporting for president.

He said he would “absolutely” vote for a candidate for the opposing party, depending on who else is on the ballot.

“I’ve voted for Democrats,” Garvey said Wednesday as he made his first statewide tour as a candidate for the seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

His apparent willingness to cross party lines — and neither endorse Trump nor seek the former president’s support — would be heresy for a Republican in much of the country. But it makes sense in California for a general election, where the party now claims only a quarter of the electorate and where a GOP candidate hasn’t been elected to a statewide office since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor in 2006.

The strategy also makes sense because of the state's primary system, in which the top two candidates, regardless of party, advance to the runoff in November. Garvey, who is running against three veteran Democratic members of Congress, needs every Republican vote he can get, along with independents and moderates.

His unwillingness to embrace Trump, however, risks alienating passionate supporters of the former president who are expected to turn out for the primary in March.

“Republican math is basically impossible in California, so if you’re going to break through you have to create a new formula,” GOP strategist Rob Stutzman said.

As Stutzman sees it, Garvey pretty much needs every Republican voter, some moderate Democrats and to “dominate” independents to stand a chance.

Garvey said he was not “consciously distancing” himself from Trump, noting that he likes some of the former president’s policies but does not always agree with how he gets his message across.

He said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

“Do I think that the most dangerous disease next to Covid is Trump syndrome? Yes,” Garvey added, a reference to the media’s coverage of the former president.

At a Thursday meeting with Jewish leaders in the Bay Area city of Pleasanton, Garvey said he was not expecting a Trump endorsement — but wouldn’t say whether he would accept one either.

""I'm more concerned about the single most difficult race in America right now for a conservative moderate like myself,” Garvey said. “I don't have time to worry about him.""

While Stutzman says Garvey has the chance to ride his Trump agnosticism through the March 5 primary, he’ll have to pony up more policy positions and ad money to stand any chance in the general.

“He needs to keep a distance from Trump. But he can’t vote for Biden. And that could work for the primary,” Stutzman said, adding that Garvey needs to spend around $4-6 million in advertising to cushion his chances in March.

Beyond the spring, the road gets rockier. “If he can make the runoff, I think it’ll be very difficult. There’s a lot about Mr. Garvey that we don’t know yet. He’s not being specific about issues yet, but will have to be in the general,” Stutzman said.

Pressed on the presidential primary, Garvey dodged the question, saying he’s only interested in his own race.

“I’m going to vote for Steve Garvey,” he said. “The former president is not on my ballot. Joe Biden is not on my ballot.”

Garvey will go head-to-head with his Democratic rivals, Reps. Katie Porter, Barbara Lee and Adam Schiff, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday in Los Angeles. The first California Senate debate will air live on FOX 11 in Los Angeles, KTVU FOX 2 in the San Francisco Bay Area and will be livestreamed on POLITICO.

More Democrats than Republicans voted for it — the 4th time this has happened for must-pass bills.

Despite controlling the House, GOP leaders have consistently had to rely on Democratic votes.

The House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday evening that temporarily extends government funding — and way more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.

If that sounds familiar, that's because it's the fourth time something like it has happened this year — even though Republicans technically control the chamber by a slim margin.

""It does not matter who's sitting in the speaker's seat, or who's holding the majority,"" an angry Rep. Chip Roy of Texas declared in a floor speech ahead of the vote. ""We keep doing the same stupid stuff.""

The short-term funding bill, negotiated in part by House Speaker Mike Johnson, passed 314-108, with 207 Democrats and 107 Republicans voting for it.

106 Republicans voted against it, while just 2 Democrats did the same.

Having easily passed the Senate earlier on Thursday, the bill now heads to President Joe Biden's desk ahead what would have been a partial government shutdown on Saturday.

And it passed despite last-minute right-wing gripes, with members of the House Freedom Caucus and others trying to attach hardline immigration policies to the must-pass bill.

The right flank of the GOP conference has increasingly fumed at Johnson in much the same way they did at McCarthy, accusing him of not using must-pass bills to advance their hardline priorities — even as Democrats continue to hold the Senate and the White House.

Lawmakers now face two deadlines — March 1 and March 8 — to fund the entirety of the government for the rest of the year.

Democrats keep shouldering more of the burden of governing than Republicans

In the year since Republicans assumed control of the House — and particularly since the summer — chaos and lack of productivity have been major overarching themes.

Torn between mainstream members and hardliners who hope to enact sweeping right-wing policy changes, Republicans have often shown themselves unable to handle must-pass legislation without the help of Democrats.

The first time this dynamic came into view was at the very end of May, when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated a bill to raise the debt limit through the 2024 election. Breaching the debt limit would have led to a default on the country's debt, triggering a widespread fiscal crisis.

The House passed that bill by a 314-117 margin, with 165 Democrats and 149 Republicans voting for it. At that point, the discrepancy wasn't that great — there were aspects of the deal that Democrats disliked, and the same was true of Republicans.

Then came the end of September.

Facing a government funding deadline — aka, a possible government shutdown — McCarthy put forward a bill that would fund the government for another two months.

It passed by a 335-91 margin, with 209 Democrats and 126 Republicans voting for it. Put another way: Every vote against funding the government came from Republicans, except for one.

That vote ended up being the straw that broke the camel's back: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida forced a vote to oust McCarthy the following week, and the House was thrown into chaos for most of October.

Having squandered half of the time that they'd given themselves to pass government funding bills, the House was forced to pass another short-term continuing resolution in November, but with a twist: It would be a ""laddered,"" giving lawmakers two deadlines roughly a week apart for different parts of the federal government.

That bill passed 336-95, with 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans voting for it. Just 2 Democrats were among the opposition.

Johnson, then still brand new, was given some grace by hardliners, even though McCarthy had just been ousted for doing the same thing: putting a clean extension of government funding up for a vote.

But this time, the Louisiana Republican faced simmering and vocal anger from the right, with some even alluding to a potential vote to oust him.

""Our Speaker, Mr. Johnson, said he was the most conservative speaker we've ever had, and yet here we are, putting this bill on the floor,"" said. Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona in a floor speech ahead of the vote, adding that the situation is what ""led to us to vacate Speaker McCarthy in the first place.""

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) scorched Donald Trump on Wednesday for his role in getting Roe v. Wade overturned, saying the former president is the reason “abortion will be on the ballot in 2024.”

“He proudly put this Supreme Court in place,” Warren told MSNBC’s Alex Wagner. “He proudly screened them for their position on abortion. And he is responsible for the state of abortion in this country right now.”

Trump, who won Iowa’s GOP caucuses this week and leads the pack for the Republican presidential nomination, is still boasting about his role in packing the U.S. Supreme Court with abortion opponents, leading to the downfall of federal reproductive rights protections in 2022.

Warren predicted that if Republicans win big in November, the procedure could become completely inaccessible nationwide.

“If the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House ― and please, no ― but if that happened, I don’t think there’s any doubt they’re going for a nationwide abortion ban,” she said. “They’ve made that clear.”

— Alex Wagner Tonight (@WagnerTonight) January 18, 2024

“Abortion will be on the ballot in 2024,” Warren promised.

She listed some of the grim events that have arisen in the U.S. since the fall of Roe.

“A 10-year-old who needs an abortion and can’t get it in her state,” Warren said. “A mother who desperately wants a baby, but understands that this fetus in her is badly deformed and she needs an abortion. Another mother, whose life is at risk, and doctors stand beside her saying, ‘Is she close enough to death for us to give her an abortion under local laws?’ So, it’s watching the reality unfold [a] piece at a time.”

Lawmakers have made abortion illegal in 14 states over the past 18 months. But voters have repeatedly upheld access to the procedure in places where it’s landed on the ballot ― even in deep red states and swing states, from Kansas and Kentucky to Ohio and Michigan.

Polls show that a majority of Americans support some degree of access to abortion. In a 2023 Gallup poll, a record-high 69% of people said abortion should generally be legal during the first three months of pregnancy, and 52% said abortion is morally acceptable.

House Republicans are making the bill a priority, and the chairman of the House Budget Committee said “everything's on the table” regarding possible action to slow the federal government's increasing level of debt, now at more than $34 trillion. Many Democrats see the commission as an attempt to force cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

The bill, approved by the GOP-majority committee by a 22-12 vote, would ask the commission to recommend ways to balance the budget at the earliest reasonable date and to improve the long-term solvency of Medicare, Social Security and other programs paid for through trust funds. The commission would have 16 members: 12 from Congress, evenly divided by party, and four outside experts who would not have voting power.

Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, have sponsored a companion measure in the Senate.

Similar commissions have succeeded in the past, but recent ones have mostly failed due to partisan divisions. Republicans blame federal spending for the annual deficits while many Democrats cite tax cuts enacted under Republican administrations. That divide was again on display during debate Thursday, raising doubts about whether a new commission could make any headway.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, the committee chairman, said both parties are guilty of not being responsible fiscal stewards. He said the yearly struggles to pass spending bills show a broken process that makes it hard to address the country's financial challenges.

“We all own this,” said Arrington, R-Texas. “We're all in this boat together. The boat is sinking.”

The committee's top Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, said he fears that some lawmakers want to use the commission “as a backdoor way to force through unpopular cuts.” He said Congress needs to have the courage to increase the revenues going into Social Security and Medicare, which would put both programs on firm financial footing for decades ahead.

“We don't need a commission to do that,” he said.

The hearing began with a protester being led away by U.S. Capitol Police while yelling “no cuts to Social Security, no cuts to Social Security.” Some 116 House Democrats wrote a letter last week to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, opposing the bill and calling it “a direct circumvention of the process to expedite cuts to Social Security.”

Johnson praised the committee's vote, calling it “a positive step towards fiscal sanity.” Jeffries said before the vote he would evaluate the proposal after it got out of committee and that he supported various Democratic amendments that were to be offered to the bill. In the end, those Democratic amendments were rejected.

“If it's not clear that Social Security and Medicare are protected, then it will be my expectation that there will be a lukewarm response at best when it hits the floor,” Jeffries said.

Some Democrats do support the establishment of the debt commission. Three committee Democrats voted for it, including Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., who worked with Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich. in sponsoring the bill. Peters said cuts to Social Security are already factored into current law and once the program exhaust its reserves in less than a decade, then participants would see their benefits cut by about 24%.

“Whether you're 72 or 92, rich or poor, you're going to get cut,” Peters said. “Now, we can pretend that doing nothing is going to solve the problem. We can pretend that regular order is going to take care of it. I choose to offer a different path.”

He said he wants to save the program and not cut benefits, but the longer Congress waits to tackle the problem, “the more leverage we give to the people who want to cut benefits.”

Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said she is concerned when she hears Arrington say “everything is on the table” for the commission.

""There are some things that should absolutely not be on the table, and that's because the wealth gap in this country is obscene,” she said.

The commission would be required to hold at least six hearings across the country. A final report and recommendations would be due by May 2025, Arrington said. The recommendations would get an expedited vote in Congress if they win the approval of a majority of the commission, including at least two members of each party.

Earlier this month, attorneys for Trump asked U.S.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ti6lqIr8.LQ55mhIltAx8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/c1eafd3fb8d6ef039c1e49653726721a,"WASHINGTON — The judge overseeing the federal election interference case against former President Donald Trump has rejected his request to hold special counsel Jack Smith and his office in contempt.

Earlier this month, attorneys for Trump asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to hold Smith in contempt for filing motions while the case is stayed pending Trump’s appeal on presidential immunity grounds.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia)

Chutkan, however, said in her opinion and order Thursday that she agrees with Trump that Smith’s filings place a ""cognizable"" burden on him, and that although it was ""not a major burden"" for Trump's team to have to review Smith's filings, and that she would now forbid the special counsel from making substantive pretrial motions without permission going forward.

Chutkan has ordered that both parties be required to seek her permission before filing additional pre-trial motions while the stay order remains in effect.

“This measure is an addition to the Stay Order, aimed to further advance its purposes, and does not reflect a determination that the Government has violated any of its clear and unambiguous terms or acted in bad faith,” she wrote.

Chutkan wrote that continuing to produce discovery was a separate matter, and that she ""cannot conclude that merely receiving discovery or an exhibit list constitutes a meaningful burden,"" because receiving discovery ""requires no review or response"" from Trump's team.

Smith's office had explicitly notified both the court and Trump's team that it planned to continue to meet the deadlines previously set by the court. In a memo opposing Trump's motion to hold the special counsel in contempt, Smith's office noted that the office ""did what it said it would do.""

Chutkan noted in her order that Smith's office was factually correct: Her motion did not forbid the special counsel from continuing to meet deadlines.

""On its own terms, then, the Stay Order’s key operative sentence did not clearly bar the Government from voluntary rather than obligatory compliance with the Pretrial Order’s now-stayed deadlines,"" Chutkan wrote.

Trump had filed a motion that contended that the federal government violated a court order by continuing to produce discovery in the case and filing a motion while the case was paused as an appeals court considers Trump's effort to dismiss the case based on presidential immunity grounds.

The motion earlier this month came from Trump lawyer John Lauro who argued that Smith should be held in contempt for an “unlawful” production of discovery and said that federal prosecutors are engaging in “partisan-driven misconduct.”

Chutkan's opinion Thursday noted that even after she stayed the case on Dec. 13, Smith's office produced additional discovery and a draft exhibit list to Trump's legal team as well as a motion seeking to exclude certain evidence and arguments from any trial in the case.

Trump is waiting for a ruling by a federal appeals court in a case in which he argues that he's immune from being prosecuted over his election interference efforts because he was president at the time. The case is likely to end up in front of the Supreme Court.

The trial in the election case is scheduled to begin on March 4, though Chutkan suggested in her order it could be delayed as these legal matters are considered by the courts.

""Contrary to Defendant’s assertion, the court has not and will not set deadlines in this case based on the assumption that he has undertaken preparations when not required to do so,"" she wrote.

She then quoted a prior statement she made in which she said seven months would be “sufficient time” to prepare for trial, suggesting that an additional few weeks could be added since the case has been paused since December.

""There are some that are saying, 'Hey, we don't want Biden to actually get credit for doing anything on the border,"" Sen. James Lankford said.

Lankford has helped lead negotiations over a trade off of tougher immigration laws in exchange for Ukraine aid.

Republican Sen. James Lankford, the leading GOP lawmaker on bipartisan immigration talks, said that some conservatives want to tank a potential deal over concern that it could hand President Joe Biden a political win.

""There are some that are saying, 'Hey, we don't want Biden to actually get credit for doing anything on the border, because obviously, he's made a huge mess,"" Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, told The Washington Post.

Lankford has been at the center of months-long talks that would pair President Joe Biden's request for Ukraine aid with stricter immigration enforcement. Biden asked top leaders to come to the White House earlier this week as he pressed them on the urgency of getting Ukraine more military funds for its war against Russia.

The possibility that the talks might be tanked to try to hurt Biden's reelection chances are just another reminder that November's presidential election is rapidly approaching. Polling also shows that Americans are deeply unimpressed with the current situation at the Southern border. In December, federal officials recorded the highest number of illegal border crossings ever in a single month period.

Republicans have described the border as a national security disaster, raising the question why they may scuttle a deal that could give them some of the changes they are seeking.

The politics of the situation are incredibly dicey.

Conservatives and President Donald Trump have expressed skepticism about a possible Senate-led deal.

""I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions & Millions of people, many from parts unknown, into our once great, but soon to be great again, Country,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth, Wednesday evening.

Many of the skeptics have pointed to the possibility that November's elections could hand Republicans control of Washington. Some House Republicans have said that they want to see their immigration law changes, known as HR-2, in a final deal, a request that would be a non-starter in the Senate given how conservative the House legislation is compared to current law.

House Speaker Mike Johnson can't afford to greater anger conservative lawmakers, whom he needs to hold his narrow majority together especially ahead of potential limited government shutdowns.

On the left, some Democratic lawmakers are skeptical of the talks. Immigration rights advocates have pointed out that none of the discussions have included pathway to citizenship or protections for so-called Dreamers would be unprecedented. Historically, tougher border enforcement has been paired with more protections for the millions of undocumented migrants already in the US.

CONCORD, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Donald Trump and his allies are going all out to deal Republican rival Nikki Haley a back-breaking blow in next week’s New Hampshire primary, courting her donors, bashing her in TV ads and using racial-themed dog whistles that mock her heritage.

The multi-pronged effort is a sure sign that Trump’s presidential election campaign views Haley as a threat they must neutralize quickly. Trump associates have been reaching out to Haley’s top contributors, telling them the race for the Republican nomination is essentially over and suggesting it is time to come into the fold.

""I get calls all the time,"" said Fred Zeidman, a longtime Haley fundraiser from Texas who said Trump’s allies tell him: ""'We're going to win. You’re going to lose. Don’t you want to be on the right team?'""

Zeidman said his response is that Haley can win. ""Why would I get out now?"" he said. ""She's doing everything she needs to do.""

The fast winnowing of the Republican field has left New Hampshire as basically a two-candidate race between Trump, the former president, and Haley, who once served as his ambassador to the United Nations.

Polls show the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23 to be competitive, largely because Haley draws support from establishment Republicans, moderates, suburbanites and independents, who are permitted to vote in the primary. Trump continues to dominate among hard-core conservatives and working-class voters.

Trump's campaign did not respond to inquiries about strategy, but it appears clear the goal is to ensure Haley leaves New Hampshire with little momentum as the fight turns next month to South Carolina, where she served two terms as governor.

Andy Sabin, a metals magnate and Haley backer, said he, too, has been contacted by Trump’s allies but isn't ready to jump.

""I don't know in my heart if I can give (Trump) financial support. I just have to be in the mood. And I'm not,” Sabin said. ""I can’t like him as a person. I can't find him likeable. But I do find he was a good president.""

AD BLITZ

Trump and his forces have stepped up attacks on Haley at campaign events and on television.

At a rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire this week, Trump called Haley a “disaster” and belittled her foreign policy credentials.

“She was not a good negotiator,” he said. “She likes to talk about how (she) negotiated with China. I negotiated with China.”

Trump’s campaign is now deploying former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who was sharply critical of Haley in debates, to continue his attacks against her at Trump events.

In a campaign memo earlier this month, Trump’s campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles slammed Haley as a phony Republican who would be forced to cobble together a coalition of “non-Republicans and Democrats” to compete.

Between December and January, spending by a top Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., on negative Haley TV ads jumped from almost $1.6 million to roughly $2.8 million, for a total of almost $4.4 million over the two months, according to data from AdImpact.

One MAGA Inc. ad accuses Haley of being soft on border security, saying she opposed the building of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

The Trump campaign is running TV ads telling voters that Haley seeks to cut Medicare and Social Security benefits, an attack typically used by Democratic candidates against Republicans.

At a rally on Wednesday in Rochester, New Hampshire, Haley made a point of saying such attacks were false. She said she would seek to reform the benefit programs. She defended her immigration record, contending she has always supported the wall.

""Just because you see a commercial...it's not true. I know Trump threw a temper tantrum about me last night, and I have seen the commercials you've seen,"" she said at the rally. ""I will always tell you the truth.""

NAME CALLING

Trump has also begun to mock Haley’s background in the same way he has done with other women politicians of color such as Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Truth Social post attacking Haley on Tuesday, Trump referred to her as “Nimrada” – a misspelling of her given first name, Nimarata, saying she had given a “wacked out” speech in Iowa, where she came in a distant third this week behind Trump.

Haley, the daughter of two immigrants from India, was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa and later took her husband’s surname. She has long used her middle name Nikki.

As of Thursday, Trump's post had received more than 17,000 likes and been “re-truthed” over 4,000 times.

A Reuters review of references to “Nimarata” and variations of the name's spelling on social media platforms shows that the name has been appearing in critical Haley posts since November.

Reuters saw an uptick in those references in December, after Haley failed to mention slavery in her response to a New Hampshire town hall question about the reason for the Civil War – comments she subsequently walked back.

Since Trump’s commanding win in the Iowa caucuses, another dynamic has emerged: Donors who want to get in Trump’s good graces as he heads toward capturing the nomination to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in the November general election.

Trump fundraiser Ed McMullen, a former ambassador to Switzerland, said DeSantis and Haley donors were now reaching out to him.

He said more than 50 donors had called him in the last week wanting to join Trump, with about 60% of them formerly with DeSantis and 30% with Haley.

""Iowa is the catalyzing event that awakened people that it’s time to get on board,"" McMullen said.

Another Republican donor, who asked to remain unidentified, said that after Trump's Iowa victory, he has been asked to come to a face-to-face meeting with Trump at his Florida estate.

""Since Iowa, the calls have ramped up,"" the donor said. ""They say: 'Come down to Mar-a-Lago, let us give you 15 minutes with Trump. Let's put all this behind us and let’s focus on beating Biden.'""

The donor said he was turning down the requests for now, but added: ""I'll be wearing a MAGA hat by summer.""

""Well, I don't think Iowa means anything,” Biden told reporters Thursday, when asked about the implications of Trump’s victory for his own reelection efforts.

“The president got 50-some-thousand votes, the lowest number of votes anybody who's won got. You know, this idea that he's going to run away, he can think anyway he wants, let him make that judgment,” Biden said.

The former president won less than 57,000 votes on Monday, during a caucus in which turnout was hampered by record-breaking low temperatures, days of blizzard conditions and a generally uncompetitive race in the state.


While other Iowa winners have gotten far less numerical votes than Trump in contests with more competitive fields — Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) won the 2016 caucuses with 52,000 votes, which accounted for roughly 28 percent of the vote, for example — turnout was very low earlier this week.

According to The Des Moines Register, the 110,000 voters who came out to caucus represented just 15 percent of Iowa’s registered Republicans. Turnout was the lowest it’s been in a GOP presidential primary in 24 years, according to Business Insider.

Trump, however, handily defeated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won just over 21 percent of the vote, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who came in with slightly over 19 percent.

With Trump still crushing his Republican opponents in national polls and Biden dominating a Democratic field that includes Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, the pair appear to be headed for a rematch in November.

Trump, Haley and DeSantis will all appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot on Tuesday. Biden will not be on the ballot in the Granite State next week — although his allies have launched a write-in effort to hand him a win there anyway.

After correcting the gaffe within a day, Nick Wilson – a Republican representative in Kentucky’s house of representatives – expressed hope that the misstep would not doom a measure whose purpose is to combat familial abuse.

Wilson told the Guardian on Thursday that the entire episode was “frustrating” and “embarrassing”.

“Due to the subject matter of the legislation, it was obviously quite embarrassing,” Wilson said. “It was also frustrating that it blew up so quickly, just because I was on a TV show five years ago.

“I didn’t get a chance to fix the mistake – not even one day. I feel like most legislators would get that opportunity.”

Wilson introduced a bill on Tuesday which in effect proposed removing first cousins from a list of unlawful incestuous relationships.

A fierce backlash met the move quickly after a New York public defender and fellow Survivor alum, Eliza Orlins, went on TikTok to condemn Wilson’s proposal.

“Kentucky – like so many other places – is facing a lot of issues, and this is Nick’s top legislative priority,” Orlins said. “No matter what Nick’s weird priorities are, your voices matter, and when your voices are heard, it actually has an impact in local politics.”

After wishing a great day to her TikTok audience, she addressed Wilson directly. “Nick Wilson, I hope you have the day that you deserve,” she said.

Wilson subsequently reversed course and said it was an unintentional “mistake” to have omitted first cousins from a list of relationships that Kentucky law defined as incestuous if they involved sex.

“During the drafting process [of the bill], there was an inadvertent change, which struck ‘first cousins’ from the list of relationships included under the incest statute, and I failed to add it back in,” Wilson said in a statement. “During today’s session, I will withdraw [the measure] and refile a bill with the ‘first cousin’ language intact.”

Many US states, including Kentucky, outright prohibit marriages between first cousins, while 19 states and the District of Columbia allow such a union. Some states, like Arizona and Maine, allow marriages between first cousins with certain exceptions.

The commonwealth of Kentucky defines incest as: “deviate sexual intercourse [or] sexual contact with a person whom he or she knows to be his or her parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, great-grandparent, great-grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, brother, sister, first cousin, ancestor, or descendant”.

Wilson has since refiled the measure as house bill 289. And in addition to sexual intercourse, the measure adds “sexual contact” to the definition of incest.

The reintroduced bill also adds incest to the violent offender statute.

Wilson said his new bill made no other changes to current law.

After making changes to the bill, Wilson said: “This is a bill to combat a problem of familial and cyclical abuse that transcends generations of Kentuckians. I understand that I made a mistake, but I sincerely hope my mistake doesn’t hurt the chances of the corrected version of the bill. It is a good bill, and I hope it will get a second chance.”

Wilson also told the Guardian that he hoped the scrutiny he encountered leads to more awareness surrounding the issue of sexual abuse within family homes.

“There have been many foster parents and survivors of sexual abuse reach out to me to thank me for pursuing this change in law,” Wilson said. “The amount of hopefulness I get from those calls and emails are much greater than any feelings of embarrassment or frustration that I’ve experienced in the past two days.”

Wilson was previously a public defender and in 2022 ran unopposed for the state house representing its 82nd district. He competed in the reality TV show Survivor in 2018 and 2020 and was the competition’s champion in its 37th season.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), new champion for maternity leave proxy voting in Congress, told a committee witness she wants migrants separated from children they travel with.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/3645906be08670f404a3d8f3abea3a6f,"On Tuesday, freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) introduced a bill allowing House members to cast votes on behalf of new mothers unable to attend Congress in person, giving the mothers time to recover and be with their newborns without the hassle of traveling to Washington for work.

On Wednesday, in a tense exchange with a witness at a committee hearing, Luna said she wanted migrants claiming asylum at the U.S. border to be at least temporarily separated from any children who accompany them.

“The reason why we want family separation, until we can confirm if they are the actual biological parents, is because these kids are being trafficked,” she said at a House oversight hearing on immigration.

The witness, David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, had said the Donald Trump administration had engaged in unnecessary “psychological torture of children” with its family separation policy. He challenged Luna’s assertion of widespread child trafficking by people posing as young migrants’ parents, which led to the exchange.

Luna doubled down later in the day on her comment, saying in a video posted on social media she did not make apologies for endorsing the family separation policy even though it “triggered a lot of people.”

“I’m sorry that we’re breaking through your programming, but the fact is family separation and biological confirmation saves lives,” she said.

Just a day before the hearing, Luna introduced H. Res. 967, which would change the rules of the House to allow members who had given birth up to six weeks afterwards to vote by proxy.

At a press conference Thursday, Luna didn’t answer directly when asked if she saw any contradiction in her stances.

“I think we need to focus on the maternity vote by proxy,” she said.

“What I can tell you is I don’t make any apologies for that statement,” she said of the family separation dustup. “I would absolutely rather have my child confirmed that that’s my biological child if someone was claiming to be their parent.”

House Republicans strenuously opposed proxy voting when it was instituted by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as a safety measure.

But Luna, who gave birth to a son named George Henry in August, told the New York Times her perspective had changed in part because of post-pregnancy medical complications that kept her from being able to travel for a while.

“You’re being forced to choose between your career and having a family,” she said.

On Thursday, she said the bill should get bipartisan support, with Democrats being “pro-women” and Republicans being “pro-family,” but said both sides have reservations.

“We champion pro-life and and pro-family values, but there’s some hesitancy I think on supporting it,” she said.

Luna’s bill had drawn 24 co-sponsors as of Thursday. Only four were Republicans, however, and two of those were women, Reps. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) and Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.).

Fearing a backlash from the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision allowing states to restrict abortion access, Republicans are trying to emphasize their family-friendly credentials ahead of November.

“We want to make it easier for working mothers and moms and dads to start and raise a family,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said at a press conference on Wednesday.

Luna herself leaned into her own new role in her back-and-forth at Wednesday’s hearing.

When Beir started to challenge her by saying, “As a father,” Luna cut him off.

“I’m a mother,” she said. “We can go back and forth.”

Nikki Haley took the stage at Hampshire Hills Athletic Club in Milford, New Hampshire, in early January, two state Republicans who had openly quarreled a year earlier over whether the 2020 election had been stolen from former President Donald Trump rallied the crowd in her support.

Retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, a veteran of 10 tours in Afghanistan and one of Haley's first endorsements, was the first to speak, touted Haley's support of his failed 2022 Senate run and explained why he signed on to be her New Hampshire campaign chair.

Who's running for president in 2024? Meet the candidates — and the ones who've dropped out

""She was a mentor to me, and I realized I was making a lot of mistakes,"" Bolduc admitted to the audience of over 700. ""It was made clear by a lot of people while I was running, 'The guy's not a politician.'""

New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu endorsed Haley in mid-December and has taken her around the state in hopes of defeating Trump in the state's first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23.

""As the general said, [Haley is] the opportunity to get behind a candidate that unifies everybody together, that next generation of conservative leadership,"" Sununu told the crowd packed onto the basketball court in the athletic club.

New Hampshire's open primary allows undeclared voters, who make up about 40% of the state's voting bloc, to participate in either party's primary election. It means Haley's path to victory depends on her appeal to that group, as well as the state's conservative base, which makes up about 30% of registered voters in New Hampshire.

A seminal moment in Bolduc's 2022 race was his flip-flop over whether he believed the election had been stolen from Trump, an opinion shared by 19 other 2022 GOP Senate candidates, according to a CBS News analysis.

""I signed a letter with 120 other generals and admirals saying that Donald Trump won the election and, damn it, I stand by [it], Bolduc said in an August 2022 debate against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan.

""I'm not switching horses, baby. This is it,"" he added.

But weeks later, Bolduc backtracked, saying on Fox News that after he had ""done a lot of research,"" he had come to the ""definitive"" conclusion that ""the election was not stolen,"" though he claimed there was still fraud.

Haley's comments about her support for election deniers have not always been accurate. In a 2022 interview with the ""Today"" show, she said that she would not campaign for candidates who had denied the results of the 2020 election.

""Everybody that I'm helping acknowledges the fact that the elections, you know, were real,"" Haley said.

However, Haley had campaigned for Bolduc both before and after his remarks claiming Trump had won the election. She also campaigned for or endorsed other GOP Senate candidates who cast doubt on the results of the 2020 election: Adam Laxalt of Nevada, Herschel Walker of Georgia, Mehmet Oz of Pennsylvania and Ted Budd of North Carolina. Only Budd ultimately won his race.

Sununu was one of Bolduc's most vocal critics, calling him a ""conspiracy-theorist-type candidate."" In the Senate Republican primary, Sununu backed Bolduc's challenger in the race, Chuck Morse.

In response, Bolduc called Sununu a ""Chinese Communist sympathizer."" But after Bolduc won the primary, Sununu eventually supported him in the general election.

""Governor Sununu and I agreed that the comments we made about the 2022 race were put to bed at the Republican breakfast after the [2022] primary,"" Bolduc wrote in a text message to CBS News. ""We both agreed that campaigns get sporty, things get said, and when the dust settles we must unite for the greater good.""

The Haley campaign has touted the endorsements of both men, featuring them in separate ads in recent weeks. Sununu is a popular governor who won reelection in 2022, decisively winning traditionally Democratic areas like Manchester, Nashua and Merrimack, as well as the Republican-leaning parts of the state.

Haley, for her part, has sought to appeal to both independents and Republicans on issues like abortion, mentioning the need to find a national ""consensus"" on an abortion ban, but also pledging to not judge anyone for being pro-abortion rights.

Trump won the 2016 GOP primary in New Hampshire and he lost the state by less than 3,000 votes in the general election, although President Biden had a more decisive victory of nearly 50,000 votes in the state in 2020. Trump leads recent polls for the GOP primary this year, but Bolduc and Sununu both hope voters across the state are ready to move on in the name of selecting a unifying nominee.

Bolduc's involvement in Haley's campaign isn't without risk. A longtime New Hampshire political operative told CBS News he was polled via text by the Haley campaign on Bolduc's favorables, suggesting that Haley's team has some concerns about Bolduc's appeal to GOP primary voters, particularly independents.

""I wonder if they've calculated the paradoxical effect of Bolduc, and if they calculated the net loss percentage of putting him up front,"" the operative added. ""They'll realize at some point after the fact they made a mistake here.""

""Nikki is winning over Granite State voters of all sorts, from former Trump supporters to grassroots Republicans to Independents. That's the winning formula for beating Joe Biden in a landslide, which is what all the polls show she will do,"" a Haley spokesperson told CBS News.

Trump's campaign declined to comment on the dynamic between Bolduc and Sununu.

""Like Nikki, I believe that President Trump was the right president in 2016. I also supported Trump in 2020,"" Bolduc told CBS News. ""Unfortunately, President Trump over the last four years has not moved forward and has become more divisive. He is incapable of doing the most important thing for all Americans and that is uniting the country.""

""If America does not unify, we will destroy ourselves from within,"" Bolduc warned, calling on far-right Republicans, moderates, and further-left Democrats to come together to support her. ""We must come together for the future of our children and grandchildren.""

The strategy reflects an urgent desire to end the race quickly and avoid an extended and expensive battle for delegates heading into Super Tuesday on March 5.

Trump is facing 91 criminal charges in four jurisdictions, as well as two costly civil trials, where he has used voluntary appearances at New York courthouses this month as public relations and fundraising vehicles. But February offers him few such opportunities, meaning he would need to rely on his political strength alone to generate momentum for Super Tuesday, when voters in 16 states and territories will cast ballots for the nomination.

In New Hampshire, Trump began attacking Haley with paid advertising weeks ago, and intensified the onslaught more recently with sharper personal criticisms and campaign statements portraying her as a China-loving globalist. On Tuesday, he went after Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, on his social media website, using her birth name — Nimarata, which he misspelled as “Nimrada” — as a dog whistle, much like his exaggerated enunciation of former President Barack Obama’s middle name, “Hussein.”

And he has grown more aggressive on the campaign trail. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Wednesday night, he said of Haley, “I don’t know that she’s a Democrat, but she’s very close. She’s far too close for you.”

But his team is looking ahead to the South Carolina primary Feb. 24 as a “Waterloo” for his primary rivals, according to one Trump adviser, likening the state to the battlefield where Napoleon met his final defeat. Their aim is to humiliate her in her home state.

“South Carolina is where Nikki Haley’s dreams go to die,” another senior Trump adviser, Chris LaCivita, said in a brief interview.

Trump has been privately courting Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, hoping to win his endorsement before the primary. Trump allies who have relationships with Scott, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have been assisting the effort.

Republicans across the country, including senators who were previously skeptical of Trump, are assisting his strategy by consolidating their support, rushing to declare the race over, rolling out endorsements and demanding that his rivals quit immediately to “unify” the party against President Joe Biden.

Their efforts are being aided by the conservative news media, which has turned sharply against DeSantis after giving his candidacy favorable coverage early on.

The inevitability strategy also appears to be bearing fruit within the business community. On Wednesday morning, one of Wall Street’s most powerful CEOs, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase — who as recently as November urged donors to “help Nikki Haley” — praised aspects of Trump’s record and scolded Democrats for vilifying the former president’s Make America Great Again movement.

Haley and DeSantis both insist their campaigns are alive and well, with plans to compete deep into March. But the reality is that a comeback victory would represent one of the greatest upsets in modern American political history. That would be especially true if Trump wins New Hampshire, since no Republican who has won two of the first three traditional early states — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — has ever lost the party’s nomination.

Haley finished a disappointing third in Monday’s Iowa caucuses but is facing what polls suggest is more favorable terrain in New Hampshire, where unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the primary and where her allies argue even a close second could provide a rationale to stay in the race. Even there, however, she needs a large turnout of unaffiliated voters to overcome Trump’s overwhelming backing from Republicans.

“She basically has to turn the Republican primary into the unaffiliated primary,” LaCivita, the senior Trump adviser, said of the state.

Haley’s path to a competitive race seems more visible than DeSantis’, but only barely: She must win the New Hampshire primary Tuesday or come in a very close second, and ride a wave of media momentum for a month before tackling Trump head-on in the state she used to govern, South Carolina, where he has a huge lead and endorsements from powerful politicians there, including the governor.

In New Hampshire, the Trump campaign is trying to engage what one adviser called a “pincer” — squeezing Haley from both ends of the ideological spectrum. An advertising campaign began lacing into her on immigration (hitting her from the right) before criticizing her for wanting to raise the retirement age for Social Security (hitting her from the left).

Haley is trying to portray Trump and Biden as two of the same: Disliked elderly politicians who are exacerbating chaos and division in America. It’s a message tailored for independent voters who have tired of Trump, but the message will most likely have far less purchase among Republican voters.

While Haley is courting independent voters in New Hampshire, it’s harder to see how a Republican candidate can win a Republican nomination without much stronger support from Republicans.

On Wednesday, Haley’s campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, rejected the notion that Haley’s strategy was to rely on independent and crossover Democratic voters to make up for softer support among Republicans.

Ankney said the strategy has always been to do well in New Hampshire, roll out with momentum into South Carolina and then go head-to-head against Trump on Super Tuesday, when independents have historically made a difference in open or semi-open primaries, including in 2016 for Trump.

Polls showing Trump far ahead in Texas and other Super Tuesday states should not be taken seriously, Ankney insisted, because “people have not started to pay attention” in those states and “there has been zero advertising.” The Haley campaign is optimistic that she can perform especially strongly in March states that have larger populations of college-educated voters, including Virginia.

Trump’s team is far less worried about DeSantis, who finished in second place in Iowa just 2 points ahead of Haley, but who is far behind in New Hampshire. The Trump team suspects DeSantis will struggle to keep his candidacy financially afloat long enough to compete seriously on Super Tuesday.

The DeSantis path beyond February is murky — a fact reflected by the pro-DeSantis super political action committee’s decision Wednesday to lay off staff in some of its March 5 states. But the DeSantis team insists the candidate has no plans to drop out before South Carolina.

“There is no mathematical pathway for Nikki Haley to win the nomination,” said David Polyansky, the DeSantis deputy campaign manager. “And even if she makes it to South Carolina, no amount of Wall Street money will bail her out from losing her home state, and then it will be a two-person race between Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump.”

A majority of DeSantis’ staff is moving to South Carolina, and he will mostly stop campaigning in New Hampshire after his events Wednesday, according to a person familiar with his plans, who insisted on anonymity.

The fact that South Carolina was his first stop after Iowa was described as an intentional signal about his electoral calculations.

On a staff call after Iowa, DeSantis’ campaign manager, James Uthmeier, described DeSantis’ view: The caucuses showed that Trump doesn’t have the standing he once did after getting just over 50%, and that Republicans want an alternative, according to people familiar with what was said.

DeSantis’ advisers remain furious at the Haley camp’s decision to spend more than $20 million attacking DeSantis on television ads before Iowa, which a top aide publicly described as “greed” before the caucuses and insisted was meant to help Trump. The DeSantis team has openly accused Haley of campaigning to become Trump’s running mate and not to win, a claim that she has denied.

In a late November phone call, days before the political network founded by the billionaire Koch brothers endorsed Haley, DeSantis had warned a Koch network operative that any money they spent aiding Haley and attacking DeSantis would only help Trump, according to two people familiar with the conversation. That’s because many DeSantis voters still liked the former president and would sooner peel off and support him than back Haley, who is viewed as more moderate. DeSantis told the operative that the money should be spent going after Trump, the people familiar with the call said.

The Koch network went ahead with its endorsement of Haley and put its expensive ground operation into her service, sweeping out across Iowa and New Hampshire in a last-minute sprint of door knocking.

Another element of Trump’s inevitability messaging is his growing discussion of possible personnel for a second term. Trump, who out of superstition has long avoided discussing who might serve in his administration, has begun indulging discussions of who might serve alongside him.

At his Iowa victory party Monday night, Trump brought onstage Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, who had ended his own presidential campaign and endorsed the front-runner. Trump told the audience that he had Burgum pegged for an important role in his administration.

Another former rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, immediately dropped out after the caucuses, endorsed Trump and urged all other candidates to do the same. As he appeared onstage with Trump at a rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire, on Tuesday night, Trump grinned broadly as the crowd chanted, “VP, VP, VP.”

“He’ll be working with us for a long time,” Trump said. It was a whiplash reversal that’s typical of Trump. Two days earlier, he had attacked Ramaswamy as “not MAGA.”

Such rapid consolidation of the party behind Trump has visibly frustrated DeSantis and his allies, given that less than a year ago there was a moment when it seemed as if Republicans might be ready to move on and coalesce around the Florida governor.

No defection was more emblematic of the shift than that of Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Lee was an early booster of DeSantis’ presidential run and had met with the governor to discuss policy, according to a person with direct knowledge, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private meetings.

Lee did not give DeSantis a heads up before he announced that he was endorsing Trump just three days before the Iowa caucuses, that person said. The DeSantis team saw the timing as a knife in the back.

Dan Hauser, a campaign adviser to Lee, said in a statement that the senator didn’t call any candidate in the race before he endorsed Trump.

In another personal twist, Lee’s wife, Sharon, had worked for the DeSantis super PAC, Never Back Down. She left the group “a couple of months ago on her own terms,” according to Hauser.

Committee Chairman Mark Green is heading toward a vote on Mayorkas' impeachment by the end of the month, setting up action by the full House as soon as February — which would be a first for a Cabinet official in nearly 150 years.

Green, a Tennessee Republican, opened the second impeachment hearing saying “no American is safe” under Mayorkas' handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, with a record number of illegal crossings. He argued that the secretary's “egregious misconduct and failure to fulfill his oath of office” are grounds for impeachment.

But the panel's top Democrat, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who has repeatedly insisted policy differences with President Joe Biden are not grounds for impeachment, was backed up by one of the witnesses, Princeton University law professor Deborah Pearlstein.

“Policy differences, no matter how profound, is exactly not what impeachment is for,"" Pearlstein said.

She argued that no branch of the U.S. government has more power than the Congress to set policy and that, with years of inaction on border legislation, those powers have “gone unused.”

House Republicans have been eager to impeach Mayorkas since seizing majority control last year, particularly as their efforts to impeach Biden over the business dealings of his son Hunter Biden have come to a standstill.

Accelerating the action in the new year comes as the focus on border security is driving the discussion on the campaign trail. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has vowed to launch the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history if he returns to the White House.

Biden told congressional leaders this week during a meeting at the White House he wanted a “big border security” bill as he tries to drive Congress to wrap up work on his $110 billion national security package for Ukraine, Israel and other needs, including the U.S.-Mexico border.

The leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, emerged cautiously optimistic, as Senate leaders eye a potential vote on that package next week.

But hours after the White House meeting, Trump signaled his skepticism toward any border deal, “unless we get everything” to shut down the migrants crossings, he wrote on social media.

Mayorkas has been deeply involved in Senate negotiations over the border security package, which would potentially restrict entry into the U.S. and more rapidly deport those people in the country without legal documentation. He has yet to appear before the committee for the impeachment proceedings.

Frustrated that Mayorkas would not appear Thursday, Green said the secretary is “stonewalling” the panel.

But the Department of Homeland Security said Mayorkas told the committee he was unavailable Thursday but would be willing to appear on other dates. The department noted he has appeared before Congress more than any other Biden administration Cabinet member — including 27 times in 35 months.

“This is just the latest example of Committee Republicans’ sham process,” department spokeswoman Mia Ehrenberg said. “It’s abundantly clear that they are not interested in hearing from Secretary Mayorkas since it doesn’t fit into their bad-faith, predetermined and unconstitutional rush to impeach him.”

One of the witnesses, Josephine Dunn, testified that her daughter, Ashley, died of a fentanyl overdose and said that she traveled from Arizona to appear at the hearing for the opportunity to question Mayorkas.

“Mr. Mayorkas is partly responsible for my daughter's death,” she said, calling fentanyl a ""weapon of mass destruction."" “Whatever he’s doing I hope is more important than that.""

Another parent, Tammy Nobles, had previously testified before Congress.

Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, shared his own family's experiences with the friends' lives lost to drugs and said he would bring the mothers' stories to his next meetings with officials from the U.S. and Mexico.

“This is the personal side of the chaos,” he said. “It has to stop.”

Several Democrats spoke of their own concerns with the situation at the southern border, particularly as drug cartels push the flow of fentanyl, even as they stopped short of blaming Mayorkas for the magnitude of the problem.

“Let's get it together,” Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., implored his colleagues, pointing to the federal funding battles coming this spring. “Surge resources to the border.”

Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., spoke of the pain of migrants fleeing their home countries and urged Republicans to come to the table with solutions. ""Work with us to pass legislation,"" she said.

Impeaching a Cabinet secretary has happened only once before in the nation’s history, when the House impeached Defense Secretary William Belknap in 1876 over kickbacks in government contracts.

It's unclear if Republicans, with only a very narrow majority in the House, will push ahead with impeachment if they don't have enough support from their ranks. So far, a handful of Republicans have expressed reservations, but some who initially voted to shelve the issue have indicated they are more willing to proceed.

If Mayorkas were to be impeached, the charges would next go to trial in the Senate, where it takes a super-majority to convict. In the Belknap impeachment, he was acquitted.

Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign staffer, filed the motion to disqualify Willis from the case earlier this month, accusing her of acting “to defraud the public of honest services.”

The motion asserts that Willis had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to oversee the case against Trump. Wade has been paid more than $650,000 in legal fees since January 2022.

During a speech this week at Atlanta’s Big Bethel AME Church, Willis defended the hire, calling Wade a “great friend and a great lawyer” who’s been paid the same rate as the other special prosecutors employed to work the case.

“I’m a little confused. I appointed three special counselors,” Willis said Sunday. “It’s my right to do, paid them all the same hourly rate. They only attack one. I hired one white woman, a good personal friend and a great lawyer, a superstar, I tell you. I hired one white man — brilliant — my friend and a great lawyer. And I hired one Black man, another superstar.”

Notably, Roman’s filing provides no hard evidence for the allegation, instead basing the claim on “sources close to both” Wade and the district attorney.

In a separate motion Thursday, Willis accused Wade’s estranged wife, Joycelyn Wade, of “conspiring with interested parties” in the election case “to annoy, embarrass and oppress” Willis.

Nathan Wade and Joycelyn Wade are currently in divorce proceedings after she had a romantic affair with a third individual, the motion further alleges, while accusing her of “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”

Even if there’s no merit to the claims, a delay in the trial against Trump could pay big dividends. Trump would presumably claim immunity if he wins the presidential race in November ― and could postpone a verdict until then.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee asked the state to respond to the claim by Feb. 2, with a hearing set for Feb. 15.

Meanwhile, the trial against Trump and 18 co-defendants ― including Roman ― for their roles in attempting to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election is tentatively set to begin Aug. 5.

JUST IN: Judge McAfee sets an evidentiary hearing on Mike Roman's motion to disqualify Fulton County DA Fani Willis based on alleged ""improper"" relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

(Reuters) -A judge in the Georgia election interference case against former U.S. President Donald Trump has set a hearing next month over accusations that the Fulton County district attorney and a top deputy had an improper relationship and mishandled public money, according to a court filing.

In a Thursday order, Judge Scott McAfee set a Feb. 15 hearing to discuss allegations by a Trump co-defendant who accused Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis of engaging in an ""improper, clandestine personal relationship,"" with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

The filing by Michael Roman cites unnamed sources and sealed records in Wade's ongoing divorce case.

A representative for Willis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Willis' spokesperson previously said the district attorney's office would respond to the accusations through court filings.

A lawyer for Willis said in a Thursday court filing in Wade's divorce case that Wade's estranged wife, Joycelyn Wade, is using court documents to ""annoy, embarrass and oppress"" Willis, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, citing a court document that the paper posted online.

The records in that case are sealed, and Reuters could not obtain the document.

Willis' lawyer could not be reached for comment, and Wade did not immediately respond to a voicemail left with his office.

Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, is accused along with 18 co-defendants of seeking to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state to President Joe Biden.

Trump and Roman have both pleaded not guilty.

Roman's filing claims Wade, a private attorney appointed by Willis to assist in the case, is not qualified for his role and been paid roughly $1 million, citing invoices attached as exhibits.

Trump often uses his legal travails to rally supporters and raise money for his campaign, denouncing the four criminal cases he faces as political witch hunts.

While he has not yet moved to disqualify Wallis, Trump will almost certainly cite the misconduct allegations as he seeks to discredit the case.

It would not end the case if McAfee disqualifies Willis, though it could lead to delays that might be helpful for Trump.

“They would probably appoint another prosecutor from a different county, so it wouldn’t mean the case is thrown out,” said Jerry Froelich, a Georgia criminal defense attorney who is not involved in the case.

Trump has separately been indicted in Washington for his efforts to reverse his election loss, in Florida for mishandling of classified documents upon leaving office and in New York for hush money payments to a porn star.

He has pleaded not guilty in all of those cases.

""A president of the United States must have full immunity, without which it would be impossible for him/her to properly function,"" Trump said in a lengthy post on Truth Social in all caps. ""Any mistake, even if well intended, would be met with almost certain indictment by the opposing party at term end. Even events that 'cross the line' must fall under total immunity, or it will be years of trauma trying to determine good from bad.""

""Sometimes you just have to live with 'great but slightly imperfect,'"" Trump added. ""All presidents must have complete & total presidential immunity, or the authority & decisiveness of a president of the United States will be stripped & gone forever. Hopefully this will be an easy decision. God bless the Supreme Court!""

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is expected to soon issue a ruling in the case brought by Trump in his effort to dismiss the federal election interference case against him. He has claimed that he should be immune from prosecution because his efforts to overturn the 2020 election fell within his official duties as president.

The judges heard oral arguments regarding the immunity question earlier this month and they appeared to be skeptical of the former president's position.

The court could issue a ruling that decisively resolves the immunity question, thereby allowing the election interference trial, scheduled to begin March 4, to move forward.

The judges could also issue a narrower ruling that could leave some issues unresolved. The court could also simply rule that Trump had no right to bring an appeal at this stage of the litigation.

It's likely, however, that the case will wind up before the Supreme Court, which sidestepped the immunity question in December.

The former president has argued that his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and his involvement with the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection were part of his presidential responsibilities. He has said that he was investigating election fraud as president at the time even though there was no evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump's Truth Social post came after he sat in a New York courtroom Wednesday in a trial to determine damages in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against him.

Brian Kemp told world business leaders Thursday.

Speaking as part of a panel focused on electric vehicles at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Republican governor highlighted the construction of the Georgia Power’s two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, near Augusta — the country's first new reactors in decades.

“We’ve done as much as anybody in the country ... but we’re going to have to have more,” Kemp said, although he did not call for closing any current power plants that burn coal, natural gas or oil.

It's Kemp's second year in a row to visit the forum of world business and political leaders. He told The Associated Press on Thursday in Davos that the trip is aimed at “really just selling the state from an economic development standpoint.”

That includes touting the electricity produced at Plant Vogtle. One of the reactors in the $31 billion project is generating power, while the other is expected to reach commercial operation in coming months.

“We’re letting people know that we got a great airport, great seaport, got a great energy supply with our two nuclear reactors that are online and coming online,” Kemp said.

The fellow members of Kemp's panel said that electric vehicles need to be made with electricity that isn't produced by burning coal, oil or natural gas that emits world-warming carbon dioxide. Zeng Yuqun, founder and chairman of Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, said a “dirty battery,"" or one produced with lots of carbon emissions, is “big trouble.”

“That’s why I’m looking for sustainability in all of this very quickly,” said Zeng, one of China's richest people.

Kemp, who said Georgia is “well on our way” to achieving his goal of being the “e-mobility capital of the world,” said he hears the need for clean energy from firms such as Hyundai Motor Group and Rivian Automotive.

“Talking to the companies that we’re recruiting, people that are looking to the state, they obviously want to produce with clean energy,"" Kemp said.

It's another instance of how Kemp has shied away from tackling climate change directly, but has welcomed some changes in the name of business recruitment.

The governor said he would look to electric utility Georgia Power Co. and its Atlanta-based parent, Southern Co., to meet those clean energy needs. But environmentalists have panned a current request from Georgia Power to increase its generating capacity largely using fossil fuels.

Kemp told the AP that he remains confident in his push to recruit electric vehicle makers, despite a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the United States. He blamed a law backed by President Joe Biden that included big incentives for buying American-made electric vehicles, saying it “tried to push the market too quick.”

“I think the market’s resetting a little bit now,"" Kemp said. ""But I do not think that’s going to affect the Georgia suppliers — everybody’s still very bullish on what’s going on in Georgia. And I am too.”

Kemp told the panel the biggest challenge in Georgia's electric vehicle push is making sure manufacturers and their suppliers can hire enough employees.

“That's the big thing for us, is making sure we have the workforce,” Kemp said.

Blinken's Africa trip comes as the United States is increasingly nervous about its relationships on the continent, particularly after coups last year in Niger and Gabon, and escalating unrest in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In addition, the U.S. and China are in a battle for influence throughout Africa. That topic will likely top his the agenda in Angola, which China has targeted for significant investment.

Blinken will highlight the administration's partnership with African nation on issues such as the climate, economic investment, food and health, department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.

While in Ivory Coast, Blinken may attend an Africa Cup of Nations soccer match between the host country and Equatorial Guinea.

During McCormick’s appearance on “The John Fredericks Show,” Fredericks asked McCormick how he would “stand firm to cut spending” once in the Senate.

“The No. 1 thing you do with a Senate majority and a House majority and a Republican president in the White House is you roll back all those incredible, expensive Biden bills — the infrastructure bill, the Build Back Better — all of that stuff, that’s the money that’s driving this huge uptick in inflation,” McCormick responded.

McCormick, who failed to capture the GOP Senate nomination in 2022, is hoping to unseat Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) in November. A victory for McCormick could virtually ensure a Republican takeover of the U.S. Senate during a cycle when Democrats are playing defense on a difficult map.

McCormick, right, and his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, attend a gala in Manhattan in June 2023. McCormick's position on infrastructure puts him to the right of 19 Senate Republicans.

McCormick, right, and his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, attend a gala in Manhattan in June 2023. McCormick's position on infrastructure puts him to the right of 19 Senate Republicans.

But McCormick’s opposition to the infrastructure bill — and promise to repeal it — exposes him to political attack from Democrats, who are likely to paint him as a hardline conservative out of step with voters in a purple battleground state. (Contrary to McCormick’s claim, Build Back Better did not become law; a significantly scaled back bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, did.)

The infrastructure bill passed Congress in August 2021 with the support of 19 Republican senators and 13 Republican House members, including Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs.

“Senator Casey fought to make sure the bipartisan infrastructure law will deliver thousands of good-paying jobs in Pennsylvania for years to come,” said Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. “Meanwhile, professional job-killer David McCormick’s mission is to kill off every job in the Commonwealth, from laying off workers to outsourcing American jobs and now repealing the infrastructure law.”

McCormick’s campaign defended the candidate’s stance, citing a Kimberly Strassel column in The Wall Street Journal that said that less than one-quarter of the bill’s spending went to traditional infrastructure like roads, bridges, tunnels and waterways.

“While Pennsylvania’s infrastructure needs improving, a stunning 77% of the so-called ‘infrastructure’ bill that Bob Casey rubber stamped went to fund Democrats’ ridiculous climate pet projects rather than actual infrastructure in our communities,” Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick’s campaign, said in a statement. “At a time of historic inflation, Joe Biden and Casey increased the financial burden on taxpayers, once again failing the people of Pennsylvania.” 

Strassel’s op-ed in the Journal is based on a July 2021 analysis conducted by the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist think tank, that found that the bill dedicated $110 billion to roads, bridges and major construction projects, and $17 billion to ports and waterways. That means the bill would spend just $127 billion of its $548 billion in new spending on “items that most people associate with” the term infrastructure, according to Strassel.

The final version of the infrastructure bill created $566 billion in new spending. 

But even under the old total, Strassel’s math is misleading. Strassel, McCormick, and other conservatives object to the bill’s investments in electric vehicles, environmental resilience, public transit and a greener electric infrastructure.

But CRFB’s original analysis shows that the bill included plenty more in so-called traditional infrastructure spending than Strassel admits. Key line items include $66 billion for freight and passenger rail (the latter of which Strassel claims is only used by a small subset of the population), $25 billion for airports, $11 billion to improve road safety, $65 billion to expand broadband internet service, and $55 billion for water infrastructure, such as removal of lead pipes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are set to kick off an abortion rights campaign next week on the 51st anniversary of the now-overturned Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court ruling, with speeches by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as well as advertisements focused on women affected by Republican-backed abortion bans.

With Biden running for re-election in November and his party seeking to defend its majority in the Senate and regain control of the House of Representatives, Democrats are hoping the issue of abortion rights will prove to be a winner at the ballot box.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which was issued on Jan. 22, 1973. The Roe ruling had recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide. Since it was reversed, Republicans at the state level have passed numerous restrictive abortion laws.

Harris is scheduled to travel to Wisconsin on Monday - the Roe anniversary - to put a spotlight what the Biden campaign called a Republican ""all-out assault"" on reproductive rights.

The Biden campaign said that the president, Harris and their spouses will take part in a campaign rally in Northern Virginia the following day. A campaign press release said the rally is intended to highlight the stakes of the Nov. 5 election ""for a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions,"" citing ""the very possible reality"" of a Republican-led national abortion ban in the future contrasted with Biden's commitment to signing legislation that would enshrine Roe's abortion rights into law.

Biden aides think the issue of reproductive rights will be particularly potent in northern Virginia, where Democrats need voters from the affluent Washington suburbs to carry the state in the election.

Most opinion polls, including a Reuters/Ipsos poll in July, have shown a majority of U.S. voters expressing opposition to presidential candidates who favor strict abortion limits.

Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Biden, last week said he was ""proud"" of his role in overturning Roe. The three conservative Supreme Court justices who Trump appointed during his presidency were pivotal in the decision overturning Roe.

""Donald Trump is the reason that more than one in three American women of reproductive age don't have the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions,"" Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement, adding that Trump and his party now want to ""go even further if they retake the White House.""

""Trump directly paved the way for Republican extremists across the country to enact draconian bans that are hurting women and threatening doctors. In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country,"" she added.

Biden's campaign also said it will launch a new advertising campaign targeting women and swing voters in election battleground states, focusing on the personal impact that abortion bans have had on women and providers.

The overturning of Roe was a triumph for conservatives, but appears to have turned abortion into a political liability for Republicans. All seven statewide ballot questions about reproductive rights since 2022 have resulted in victories for abortion rights advocates, including in conservative-leaning states such as Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky.

Voter backlash on abortion rights also was credited by many political analysts with limiting the scale of Republican gains in the 2022 congressional midterm elections - though Republicans did win control of the House - as well as propelling Democrats in 2023 to election victories in Virginia and Kentucky.

The party has now secured at least 12 spots on ballots for the 2024 election.

Researchers previously noted that a third-party candidate would likely hurt Biden more than Trump.

As of Wednesday, ""No Labels"" has officially been recognized as a political party in Kansas, further paving the way for a candidate to make a third-party presidential run this cycle.

According to a press release from the Kansas Secretary of State's office, the party met the requirements to become a minor party in the state after submitting the number of signatures equal to about 2% of Kansas' 2022 gubernatorial election turnout, roughly 20,000.

With its recognition in Kansas, the No Labels party will now be on the ballots of at least 12 states, though the party's yet to endorse a candidate publicly.

In 2023, Sen. Joe Manchin — who's retiring at the end of his term — appeared at a No Labels fundraiser, sparking concern from some of his Democratic colleagues in Congress.

""If No Labels runs a Joe Manchin against Donald Trump and Joe Biden, I think it will be a historic disaster,"" said Rep. Dean Phillips in May, several months before he himself declared a run for president on the Democratic ticket against President Joe Biden.

""And I speak for just about every moderate Democrat and frankly most of my moderate Republican friends,"" he said.

The party may, ultimately, not choose a current Democrat for a White House bid. In July 2023, Business Insider reported that one of the party's leaders said the decision could come down to chance.

""It would be a very interesting experiment,"" said former Utah Gov. Jon Hunstman. ""Flip of a coin? How all major decisions are made.""

And though the party has said it's staunchly against former President Donald Trump's bid for office, Democratic strategists have warned No Label's efforts will only help Trump get re-elected.

In a report published Thursday by the Allbritton Journalism Institute's ""News of the United States,"" No Labels leader and former Democratic Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon suggested that while Republican Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in 2021, ""Democrats are contributing"" to the country's worsening political rhetoric.

""It wasn't a Republican who said Fetterman could wear shorts from sleeping to the Senate floor,"" Nixon said, in reference to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's move in 2023 to alter the chamber's dress code for Sen. John Fetterman, who's well known for his casual dress.

Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court's conservative majority two years ago. Trump has taken credit for the outcome because as president he appointed three justices to the nine-member court.

Biden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement that Trump as president “paved the way” for “draconian bans.”

“In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country,” she said. ""These are the stakes in 2024 and we’re going to continue to make sure that every single voter knows it.”

Biden's campaign said its advertising campaign would focus on how abortion restrictions have affected women and health care providers.

In addition, several political allies — including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper — are hosting their own events focused on battleground states.

The Miami Republican David Borrero, an extremist who is simultaneously pushing a bill that would in effect ban all abortions in the state, also believes students are being “radicalized and evangelized” in Florida’s classrooms.

His proposed flag legislation – which advanced from a crucial rule of law subcommittee hearing on a 9-4 party line vote on Wednesday – would outlaw any flag that depicts a “racial, sexual orientation and gender, or political ideology viewpoint”. Teachers would also be prevented from wearing Pride or Black Lives Matter pins on their lapels if the legislation passes.

“Public classrooms should not be the place where our kids go to be radicalized and evangelized into accepting these partisan, radical ideologies,” Borrero said during the meeting of the constitutional rights, rule of law and government operations subcommittee.

“It’s wholly inappropriate to be putting those types of flags in front of public school students and in government buildings.”

Borrero’s bill would also prevent the flags at offices of state and local authorities, and public buildings throughout Florida.

Democrats pushed back against the proposal, the latest in a long line of attacks by Florida Republicans on LGBTQ+ rights. Other measures signed into law by the hard-right governor, Ron DeSantis, in recent months include the so-called Don’t Say Gay law banning classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare, and the banning of books, even including dictionaries, for perceived sexual or inappropriate content.

In the latest move against what DeSantis sees as “woke ideology” pervading Florida campuses, the state’s board of education on Wednesday banned public colleges and universities from using state or federal funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.

“The legislature has overreached to vilify diversity, ban books and shame our LGBTQIA youth and adults,” the Democratic state senator Tracie Davis said at a press conference in Tallahassee for Equality Florida, highlighting what it calls a Republican “slate of hate” of new anti-trans bills.

“Banning books does not ban LGBTQ youth or adults and it will not eliminate them. Restricting access to Black, queer and other diverse media does nothing to protect our children – it actually harms them.”

Another Democratic state senator, Shevrin Jones, who is gay, told the committee meeting that Borrero’s bill, which also seeks to ban lawmakers displaying Pride flags in their offices, was “authoritarian”.

“Are we in Cuba? Are we in Russia? That’s fascism at its best,” he said, noting he had a colorful Pride at the Capitol poster in his office lobby.

“How I was raised, the rainbow meant hope. I can promise you – it wasn’t that that made me gay. I’m not taking a damn thing down. I want everybody to see it.”

Parents who spoke at the hearing pinned the blame on DeSantis, pointing out that his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was tanking because the governor’s agenda is seen as too extreme.

“You are making enemies you are not supposed to have,” one father, who said he was a Republican, told the politicians, according to WFLA news. “We have seen proof that this has failed. DeSantis got the floor wiped with him, and you are anchoring your political careers to that sunk ship.”

The bill’s co-sponsor, the Republican state congressman Randy Fine, said critics “have no idea what they’re talking about”, and said he supported previously voiced comments that “the movement”, presumably meaning the LGBTQ+ community, was “trying to go too far”.

Michele Rayner, a Democratic congresswoman who is Black and lesbian, said she was angry that more anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was being introduced instead of measures to try to solve Florida’s affordable housing and property insurance crises.

“Once again, we’re focusing on things nobody has asked us to focus on,” she said.

The bill moves on for discussion in the Florida House’s state affairs committee, where its fate is uncertain. Similar legislation introduced by Borrero last year failed to advance from the same constitutional rights subcommittee it cleared on Wednesday.

The Democratic-led Senate voted 77-18 on final passage after considering a few amendments. The Republican-led House soon followed suit, passing it by a vote of 314-108.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law before the funding expires Friday at midnight.

It is the third stopgap bill since last September as the divided Congress struggles to agree on full-year government funding bills. Thursday's bill passed with mostly Democratic votes, with 107 Republicans voting for it and 106 voting against it.

A recent deal between Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on how much to spend in the new year has renewed hope of completing the process by the new early March deadlines. But that is far from guaranteed as right-wing House Republicans rebel against it.

The first stopgap bill led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker. His successor, Johnson, is seeking to avoid the same fate by selling the conservative victories in the latest deal.

Before the Senate vote, Schumer inveighed against “a loud contingent of hard-right rabble-rousers who thinks a shutdown is somehow a good thing.""

“In the twisted logic of the hard right, the theory is if enough people feel the pain of a shutdown, the hard-right can bully the rest of Congress into enacting their deeply unpopular agenda,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. “Bullying, intimidation, chaos. This is MAGA extremism in a nutshell.”

Around the same time, the House announced that it would cancel votes on Friday in anticipation of a winter storm and complete votes on the stopgap bill on Thursday.

The bill would extend the two-part government funding deadlines from Jan. 19 to March 1, and from Feb. 2 to March 8. The funding bill is unrelated to negotiations surrounding an immigration and national security supplemental bill that would provide aid to Ukraine and Israel. It's designed to give appropriators more time to craft the 12 appropriations bills that fully fund the government using the newly agreed-to spending levels.

“We need just a little bit more time on the calendar to allow that process to play out,” Johnson told reporters, saying he’s “very hopeful” that Congress can pass all 12 measures.

“We’ll see how this develops. Certainly, we’re not going to have an omnibus,"" he said, referring to the massive, last-minute spending bills Congress has frequently relied on. ""And that was a very important innovation for us to forge forward because it’s no way to run a railroad.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's lawyers urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday to reverse a judicial decision disqualifying the former president from Colorado's Republican primary ballot as the justices prepare to tackle the politically explosive case.

Trump's lawyers in court papers presented the former U.S. president's main arguments against a Colorado Supreme Court Dec. 19 ruling barring him from the primary ballot over his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, citing the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The justices have scheduled oral arguments in the case for Feb. 8.

Trump's lawyers urged the court to ""put a swift and decisive end to these ballot-disqualification efforts,"" noting that similar efforts were underway in more than 30 states.

Trump's lawyers said the 14th Amendment provision does not apply to presidents, that the question of presidential eligibility is reserved to Congress, and that Trump did not participate in an insurrection.

The brief adheres to an accelerated schedule set by the justices on Jan. 5 when they agreed to take up the case. Colorado's Republican primary is set for Mar. 5. Trump is the frontrunner for his party's nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.

The plaintiffs - six conservative Republican or independent voters in Colorado - challenged Trump's eligibility to run for office in light of his actions before the attack. They now have until Jan. 31 to respond to Trump's filing.

The Colorado ruling marked the first time that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment - the so-called disqualification clause - was used to find a presidential candidate ineligible. Section 3 bars from holding office any ""officer of the United States"" who took an oath ""to support the Constitution of the United States"" and then ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

The Colorado lawsuit is part of a wider effort to disqualify Trump from state ballots under the 14th Amendment, so the ruling by the justices may shape the outcome of that drive. For instance, Trump also has appealed to a Maine court a decision by that state's top election official barring him from the primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. That case is on hold until the Supreme Court issues its ruling in the Colorado case.

The 14th Amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the American Civil War of 1861-1865 in which Southern states that allowed the practice of slavery rebelled in a bid for secession.

The Capitol rampage was a bid to prevent Congress from certifying 2020 Biden's election victory over Trump, who gave an incendiary speech to his supporters beforehand, repeating his false claims of widespread voting fraud.

Trump also faces criminal charges in two cases related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election outcome.

The Colorado plaintiffs have emphasized the lower court's findings that Trump's intentional ""mobilizing, inciting, and encouraging"" of an armed mob to attack the Capitol meets the legal definition in Section 3. ""This attack was an 'insurrection' against the Constitution by any standard,"" they said in legal papers.

https://news.yahoo.com/hunter-biden-appear-deposition-feb-221733431.html,"Hunter Biden, President Biden, Biden family, business dealings, Republicans, contempt of Congress, James Comer","Hunter Biden to appear for deposition on Feb. 28, House GOP says","Hunter Biden will testify behind closed doors to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees in February, Republicans said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/6b4a2e75b711185ddb1bd30f4f1edea2,"Washington — Hunter Biden will testify behind closed doors on Feb. 28 before the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees, Republicans said Thursday, apparently resolving a dispute over demands for his testimony that had escalated in recent weeks.

""His deposition will come after several interviews with Biden family members and associates. We look forward to Hunter Biden's testimony,"" said Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Jim Jordan of Ohio, the committees' respective chairmen.

Both of the committees had approved contempt of Congress resolutions against President Biden's son for previously refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas for closed-door testimony amid the GOP's impeachment inquiry into the president.

The full House had been set to vote to hold him in contempt of Congress this week until Hunter Biden's attorney signaled his willingness to testify.

Republicans have argued that Hunter Biden's testimony is a ""critical component"" of their impeachment investigation as they look into whether the president profited off of his family members' foreign business dealings while he was vice president.

""With the possible exception of President Biden, [Hunter] Biden is the most important witness possessing information about President Biden's involvement in his son's business dealings,"" Republicans said in a report released last week.

Republicans have spent months investigating the president and his son's business dealings but have yet to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing.

Hunter Biden has denied that his father was financially involved in his business dealings.

He has said that he is willing to answer questions from lawmakers but would only do so in a public hearing.

The president's son made a brief surprise appearance at the Oversight Committee's hearing last week, where lawmakers debated the contempt resolution.

""Hunter Biden's willful refusal to comply with the committee's subpoenas is a criminal act,"" Comer said at the hearing. ""It constitutes contempt of Congress and warrants referral to the appropriate United States Attorney's Office for prosecution as prescribed by the law.""

After leaving the meeting, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's attorney, said, ""Republicans have sought to use him as a surrogate to attack his father.""

""And, despite their improper partisan motives, on six occasions — from February to today — we have offered to work with the House committees to see what and how relevant information to any legitimate inquiry could be provided,"" Lowell told reporters.

Kevin Morris, a Hollywood entertainment attorney, gave closed-door testimony Thursday to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees about his friendship with Hunter Biden, which began after the two met at a political fundraiser in 2019. Morris has said he loaned money to Hunter Biden over the years, which Republicans have alleged, without proof, that Morris has leveraged to gain access and influence in the Biden White House.

In a statement to CBS News following Thursday's testimony, Morris defended his actions.

""In addition to legal advice and friendship, over the course of the last four years, I have loaned Hunter money to help him through his difficulties. When needed, we each have had attorneys separately advise us on these transactions. I am confident Hunter will repay these loans. I did not and do not have any expectations of receiving anything from Hunter's father or the Biden administration in exchange for helping Hunter, nor have I asked for anything from President Biden or his administration. My only goal was and is to help my friend and client.""

The developments came after a court filing this month by Michael Roman, a co-defendant in the Trump case, alleging Willis was in a ""romantic relationship"" with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

In a filing Thursday, Willis accused Wade's wife Joycelyn Wade of trying to ""harass"" her and ""damage her professional reputation."" She alleged the wife had ""conspired with interested parties in the Criminal Election Interference Case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass and oppress District Attorney Willis.""

Willis also argued that filings in the case appeared to be ""conspicuously coordinated"" with Roman. Willis is seeking a protective order to quash a subpoena for her deposition by Joycelyn Wade. The DA said that the Wades have been living apart since 2021 and have agreed in court filings that their marriage is ""irretrievably broken,"" and that Willis does not have any information ""that might prove relevant to granting or denying the divorce.""

Roman contends that Willis, Nathan Wade and the DA's office should be disqualified from prosecuting the case and the criminal charges against him dismissed “on the grounds that the district attorney and the special prosecutor have been engaged in an improper, clandestine personal relationship during the pendency of this case, which has resulted in the special prosecutor, and, in turn, the district attorney, profiting significantly from this prosecution at the expense of the taxpayers.”

""Instead of handling this case within her office, as she could have done,"" the filing said, Willis ""chose to hire a private special prosecutor to preside over the case,"" and in doing so used the prosecution ""to pay her partner a large sum of money.""

An attorney for Willis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing in the divorce case, which was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, nor did an attorney for Roman.

Joycelyn Wade's lawyer, Andrea Dyer Hastings, said in a statement that her firm is trying ""to help Ms. Wade resolve her divorce fairly and privately, but apparently Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis would prefer to use her public platform. Clearly, this matter is personal for her.""

She said they would respond with their own court filing.

A spokesperson for the DA’s office said this month that they'd respond to Roman's allegations in a court filing and declined further comment.

In his order Thursday setting a hearing date, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee directed the DA’s office to respond to the motion by Feb. 2.

Roman's filing does not provide direct evidence to support the claims, citing only “sources with knowledge” while raising questions about the process by which Willis hired Wade.

Roman's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, has told NBC News that some of the evidence could not be shared until Wade’s divorce records are unsealed.

“At a hearing, the concrete evidence would be presented,” she said.

Roman, a former Trump White House aide and campaign staffer, was one of 19 people charged in the case. He is accused of conspiring to organize “alternate electors” to cast votes for Trump after Joe Biden won the election in the state in 2020.

Four defendants have pleaded guilty in the case, while the others, including Roman and Trump, have pleaded not guilty.

The election comes just eight days after the Iowa Republican party held in-person caucuses, in which former president Donald Trump claimed a major victory over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who came in second and third, respectively.

While Iowa is first in the nation to hold caucuses — which are different from primaries — the Granite State has prided itself for over a century on holding the first official presidential primary. However, primary day in New Hampshire will look a little different this year — starting with the fact that President Biden’s name will not appear on the Democratic party ballot.

Here’s your guide to everything you should know about the 2024 New Hampshire primaries.

What happens on primary day?

New Hampshire will hold two simultaneous elections on Tuesday, Jan. 23: one for the Republican party and the other for the Democratic party, but the latter comes with caveats (more on that later). State law mandates that polls be open for a minimum of eight hours and cannot close later than 8 p.m. ET.

As in every other presidential primary, New Hampshire Republicans will cast their ballots, selecting who they want to choose as the GOP’s nominee for president. There are 22 GOP delegates for the 2024 Republican National Convention up for grabs in the state.

New Hampshire uses a proportional method to allocate delegates to different candidates based on the statewide vote. As long as the candidate receives at least 10% of the statewide vote, they receive delegates. If there are leftover delegates, they are awarded to the candidate that got the most votes in the primary.

There will also be a Democratic primary on Jan. 23 in New Hampshire, but it will be unsanctioned by the Democratic National Committee.

What’s going on with the Democratic primary? And why won’t Biden’s name appear on the ballot?

In an effort to make the primary process more diverse, President Biden urged the DNC to hold the first official Democratic primary of 2024 in South Carolina. (It also doesn’t hurt that Biden won South Carolina’s primary in 2020, while coming in fifth in New Hampshire).

As a result, South Carolina scheduled its Democratic primary for Feb. 3, and the DNC instructed New Hampshire to hold its primary on Feb. 6, the same day as Nevada’s.

But New Hampshire state law says it has to hold its primary one week before any other similar contest. The state’s GOP-led legislature refused to break with tradition to change that law. So, New Hampshire decided to go ahead with an unsanctioned Democratic primary on Jan. 23, while threatening the DNC with legal action.

Biden is prohibited by DNC rules from competing in the New Hampshire primary, which is why his name won’t appear on the ballot, though there are efforts independent of his campaign to get the president’s name added as a write-in.

Because New Hampshire is going against DNC rules, none of the state’s 33 delegates will be awarded based on the results of the primary. This means that whichever Democrat wins the primary won’t actually advance toward the presidential nomination.

Who is on the New Hampshire ballot this year?

To get on a primary ballot in New Hampshire, candidates are required only to fill out a form and pay $1,000. This means voters will have their pick of a long list of candidates, including characters like perennial Libertarian candidate Vermin Supreme, best known for wearing a boot on his head.

Republican voters will select from among 25 candidates, including Trump, DeSantis and Haley. GOP candidates who have since dropped out of the race — such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson — will also appear on the Republican ballot, but they cannot be awarded delegates.

And while Democrats will not be able to vote for Biden, they’ll get to choose from a list of 21 other candidates, including self-help author Marianne Williamson and Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips.

What is the point of delegates, anyway?

In the primary process, a candidate needs delegates in order to advance to the next stage in the race for the White House, which is the general election in November.

A candidate who performs well in caucuses and primaries receives delegates. The more delegates a candidate is awarded, the closer they are to receiving the minimum number required to receive their party’s presidential nomination at their respective national conventions this summer. A GOP candidate needs 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates. The Democratic candidate needs 1,969 of 3,936 delegates.

The candidate who receives their party’s presidential nomination goes on to compete in the general election in November, the winner of which will ultimately become the next president of the United States.

Who can vote in the New Hampshire primary?

Only registered voters can participate, but first-time voters can register to vote the day of the primary. New Hampshire voters can also participate by absentee ballot for valid reasons, but the ballots must be turned in by Jan. 23.

Students attending college in New Hampshire from other states can also participate in the primary, as long as they don’t also vote in their home state.

The primary is considered open, which means voters cast ballots for the party they’re registered with, while undeclared voters can participate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. The deadline to switch party affiliations before the primary was Oct. 6, 2023.

Once an undeclared voter casts a ballot for a particular party, they will automatically become a registered member of that party unless they fill out a card or sign a list to return to undeclared status before leaving the polling place.

Federal prosecutors said in a court filing Thursday that Navarro “deserves severe punishment” that includes a $200,000 fine in addition to prison time. He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan 25.

Navarro, 74, was found guilty last year on two counts of contempt after he rejected a congressional subpoena to testify before the now-defunct Jan. 6 committee and provide relevant documents.

""The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law,"" prosecutors wrote in Thursday's sentencing memo.

“He cloaked his bad-faith strategy of defiance and contempt behind baseless, unfounded invocations of executive privilege and immunity that could not and would never apply to his situation,” they added.

Lawyers for Navarro did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Justice Department's sentencing request.

Navarro has said that he ignored the congressional subpoena because Trump told him to invoke executive privilege, an argument that was later rejected by prosecutors and a judge.

In a separate court filing Thursday, Navarro's attorneys asked that the court not sentence him to more than six months in prison and to pay a $200 fine.

""Despite the government’s effort to label Dr. Navarro as an insurrectionist, the reality is that his conviction arises solely from a conviction for his refusal to comply with the Select Committee’s subpoena and has nothing to do with the events that occurred at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,"" Navarro's lawyers wrote in their filing.

Navarro isn't the first former Trump adviser to face the possibility of imprisonment after defying a Jan. 6 committee subpoena. In 2022, Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months behind bars plus a $6,500 fine — prosecutors had sought six months in prison and a $200,000 fine.

Bannon has appealed his conviction, and a federal judge suspended his sentence during the appeal process.

Prosecutors drew comparisons to Bannon in their sentencing memo for Navarro.

""Like Stephen Bannon before him, throughout the pendency of this case, the Defendant has exploited his notoriety — through courthouse press conferences, his books, and through podcasts—to display to the public the reason for his failure to comply with the Committee’s subpoena: a disregard for government processes and the law, and in particular, the work of the Committee,"" prosecutors wrote.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers sent a letter to Austin on Thursday requesting his presence at a Feb. 14 hearing that will focus on how the Defense Department waited three days to tell White House officials that the Pentagon chief was in the intensive care unit. Rogers, R-Ala., launched a formal inquiry into the matter this month.

""Maintaining the most ready and lethal force possible requires that everyone in the national security community be able to rely upon the Secretary of Defense’s availability and transparency,"" said Rogers in a four-page letter to Austin. ""Regrettably, you have not exhibited these attributes throughout this most recent string of events.""

Rogers said he wants Austin to provide details about his communications with the White House and Defense Department officials, the temporary transfer of power to Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks and Austin's official actions during his hospitalization.

""I expect your full honesty and cooperation in this matter,"" Rogers said. ""Anything short of that is completely unacceptable.""

A Defense Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.

Austin was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday after being admitted there on Jan. 1 with complications related to treatment for prostate cancer.

The 70-year-old defense secretary has faced intense scrutiny over his delay in notifying the White House about the hospitalization.

Austin has said he takes ""full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure.""

""I also understand the media concerns about transparency and I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed,"" Austin said in a Jan. 6 statement. ""I commit to doing better.""

Trump’s lawyers filed a brief laying out his position ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Feb. 8.

The Colorado Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 19 that a clause in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment that prohibits “an officer of the United States” who “engaged in insurrection” from running for various federal offices applied to Trump.

The case raises various previously undecided legal questions, including whether the constitutional language applies to those running for president and who gets to decide whether someone engaged in insurrection.

In Thursday’s filing, Trump’s lawyers touched upon those themes, saying that a president is not an “officer of the United States,” that Trump did not “engage in insurrection” and that only Congress can enforce the provision in question.

“The court should put a swift and decisive end to these ballot-disqualification efforts, which threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and which promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado’s lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.

The state high court’s decision reversed a lower court’s ruling in which a judge said that Trump had engaged in insurrection by inciting the riot on Jan. 6 but that presidents are not subject to the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment because they are not an “officer of the United States.”

The state court said its ruling would remain on hold indefinitely once Trump appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Interest in the Colorado case was heightened when Maine’s top election official concluded that Trump was ineligible to appear on the Republican primary ballot in that state, too. That case was put on hold, meaning Trump remains on the ballot for now, and Trump’s appeal has also been stayed pending resolution of the Supreme Court case.

The high court’s ruling could have ramifications in all 50 states, a point made on Thursday by Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief stressing the need for a definitive decision on the issue. She mentioned that a similar challenge was filed in Michigan and although it failed in relation to the Republican primary, it could be revived for the general election in November.

“These questions must be fully answered now because election officials, like the Secretary, need to know whether the former president is eligible to appear on the ballot as a candidate, and voters deserve to know whether he is eligible to hold the office of president before casting their votes,” Benson’s lawyers wrote. Benson did not take a position on whether Trump should be deemed ineligible.

Dozens of other briefs have been filed in the case so far, including one backing Trump submitted by 179 Republican members of Congress led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Trump discussed the Supreme Court case during an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News.

“We put on three great justices, and you have some other great justices up there, and they’re not going to take the vote away from the people,” Trump said in an interview with Sean Hannity.

Trump nominated Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The initial lawsuit was filed on behalf of six Colorado voters by the left-leaning government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and two law firms. They and their supporters have a Jan. 31 deadline to file their own briefs to the Supreme Court.

But neither side expects dramatic progress from Friday’s discussions. The talks, to be attended by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, White House homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alicia Bárcena, are an extension of discussions that began in Mexico on Dec. 27, when U.S. officials flew to Mexico amid historic highs in illegal border crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.

After those conversations, Mexico began deportations of Venezuelans, a top nationality crossing into the U.S., and began interdicting more migrants crossing into Mexico from Guatemala. Those moves, as well as seasonal migration patterns, produced a dramatic plunge in the number of migrants crossing the border at the beginning of the year.

But U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the talks say not to expect deliverables from Friday’s meeting. A senior U.S. administration official who spoke to reporters on Thursday said, “We don’t expect any big announcements tomorrow.” Another senior U.S. official said there will be many more discussions over the next year.

The two sides have laid out clear objectives for what they want out of negotiations going forward, according to sources who spoke to NBC News earlier this month.

Among the priorities for Mexico is getting the U.S. to agree to committing large figures to combat migration by “addressing root causes,” meaning political corruption, violence and poverty in Western Hemisphere countries. A third senior U.S. administration official said Thursday the United States is interested in working with Mexico to address root causes.

Earlier this month, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador publicly called on the U.S. to deploy $20 billion in aid to Latin America and Caribbean countries and to suspend the sanctions on Venezuela, among other requests. At the time, a U.S official said López Obrador had an “ambitious agenda.”

Both U.S. and Mexican officials have emphasized that their ongoing negotiations are not transactional. For example, Mexico would not stop helping the U.S. with immigration if it doesn’t commit to spending $20 billion in the region. Two people familiar with the negotiations said Mexico has its own interest in curbing illegal migration because the flow of northbound migrants affects Mexico as well.

The U.S. is highly dependent on Mexico’s willingness to help, however. As talks continue in Washington this week and throughout the year, Mexico holds a significant amount of leverage.

“Hunter Biden will appear before our committees for a deposition on February 28, 2024. His deposition will come after several interviews with Biden family members and associates,” said Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan in a statement. “We look forward to Hunter Biden’s testimony.”

Comer, R-Ky., serves as the chairman of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, while Jordan, R-Ohio, is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

The two Republicans added that their committees are working with the attorney for the president’s brother James Biden to schedule his appearance as well.

The committees are scheduled to hear from business associates of members of the Biden family later this month and into February.

The White House referred NBC News to Hunter Biden’s representatives when reached for comment.

A source familiar with the discussion between staff on the Oversight and Judiciary committees and Hunter Biden’s attorneys confirmed the Republicans’ statement without explicitly saying that Biden would attend the deposition.

“His team has been in discussion with Committee staff regarding a way for Hunter to provide the facts in a way that addresses his concern,” the source said in an email, reiterating Hunter Biden's willingness to testify publicly.

“His concern has always been a pattern by Republicans to cherry-pick closed-door sessions,” the source added.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said he’s looking forward to Feb. 28 and “getting through with this thing.”

“More and more Republicans are telling me, especially now that their margin is vanishing to almost nothing, that they just don’t have the votes for impeachment,” said Raskin. “And so they have to try to keep the Hunter Biden thing going. The Hunter Biden thing is a distraction from the fact that you have a dozen or so Republicans who just won’t vote to impeach Joe Biden because they’re in divided districts.”

The president’s son had previously said he would be willing to testify at an initial public hearing, an offer Republicans had shot down, arguing they wanted him to appear for a closed-door deposition first. Hunter Biden defied the subpoena for closed-door testimony, instead appearing outside the Capitol for a press conference in December.

“I’m here today to make sure that the House committee’s illegitimate investigations of my family did not proceed on distortions, manipulated evidence, and lies,” he said last month to reporters.

House Republicans this week paused efforts to push for a resolution to hold President Joe Biden’s son in contempt of Congress as Hunter Biden's lawyers and the committees began talking about scheduling testimony. GOP lawmakers on Sunday said that they would issue new subpoenas for Hunter Biden.

Comer told NBC News on Thursday that he “absolutely” believed it was the contempt process that persuaded Hunter Biden to come in.

The reversal from Hunter Biden comes as he faced the credible threat of a House vote to hold him in contempt of Congress. Two Republican-led committees had approved that vote and it was expected to pass on the House floor. Had it passed, it would be referred to a U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C. to decide whether to prosecute Hunter Biden.

Comer also said he is still committed to letting Hunter Biden testify at a public hearing after a closed-door deposition and promised to release a transcript of the deposition “quickly” after it happens. He predicted the deposition would last about eight hours.

The GOP-controlled House voted in December to authorize its impeachment inquiry into the president over his family’s business dealings, though Republicans have not produced concrete evidence that the president committed wrongdoing or peddled his influence.

“It’s clear that the Republicans know they’ve not laid a glove on Joe Biden,” Raskin said, adding that Republicans “figure that Hunter Biden has had his name dragged through the mud enough that he’s unpopular, so they can go after him.”

(AP) — Seven Republicans vying for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Nevada circled the familiar talking points of GOP politics at a debate on Thursday, while also taking shots at the front runner who made an apparently strategic decision not to attend.

The debate in a Reno casino ballroom focused on increased border security, anti-abortion stances and cutting government spending and size, but candidates also criticized retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, whose backing in Washington, D.C., and formidable 2022 campaign have made him a fundraising juggernaut above the crowded primary field.

Nearly every candidate called out Brown for his absence and described him as an establishment candidate not willing to face voters, a combative signal by a group of lesser-known Republicans attempting to gain ground in an otherwise cordial debate.

“Don’t vote for Sam Brown. Look at one of these candidates up here,” said Bill Conrad, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and former deputy mayor of Modesto, California, who co-founded Redmove, the conservative group hosting the debate.

Brown’s campaign said the decision to skip the debate reflected his comfortable lead in resources and grassroots support. The non-engagement strategy has been employed by other campaign front-runners, most notably by former President Donald Trump.

“The numbers say it all: Sam Brown is the only candidate in this race with the resources, support and grassroots energy to take on Jacky Rosen,” Brown’s campaign said in a statement. “Nevada Republicans are uniting behind Donald Trump and Sam Brown because they are the only conservative champions who can defeat Biden and Rosen in November.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter also was not on stage after backing out at the last minute, which his campaign did not explain in a statement following the debate.

“I will debate Scam Brown at any time,” Gunter said in the statement, employing a nickname he often uses to disparage Brown.

The other candidates on stage included Jim Marchant, a former candidate for Nevada secretary of state and outspoken election denier; Tony Grady, an Air Force veteran and former candidate for lieutenant governor; Stephanie Phillips, a real estate broker; and Ronda Kennedy, an attorney.

Former President Donald Trump has skipped all Republican primary debates in the current presidential campaign, electing to hold rallies or appear on rival television networks in a strategy that has deprived the events of viewership and media attention while he remains the dominant front-runner. The last GOP primary debate between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley drew fewer than 2.6 million viewers.

Brown, a Purple Heart recipient, was a heavily recruited candidate for Republicans in Washington looking to avoid a repeat of their lackluster showing in the 2022 midterm elections, when flawed GOP candidates helped Democrats win battleground races and hold the Senate majority.

Two years ago, Brown was a longshot Senate candidate who criticized Republican front-runner Adam Laxalt for agreeing only to a pre-recorded debate instead of a live, prime-time broadcast.

“He must feel safe at 8 a.m., on a Monday morning, in a closed studio, where working class Nevadans can’t challenge him,” Brown said of the former Nevada Attorney General, who enjoyed the backing of the Republican Party’s most influential figures, from former President Donald Trump to then-Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.

Laxalt won that primary handily but lost narrowly in the general election to incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto.

This cycle, Brown often has brushed past questions about his primary opponents to focus attacks on incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen. He said the crowded field was a product of Rosen’s leadership, not his.

But on Thursday, Rosen was seldom mentioned as Brown weathered attacks from his opponents.

“I hope you remember the one that’s not here,” Kennedy said.

Last year’s tally marked an increase from a figure released for 2022, but it's below the 9,625 cases the agency investigated in 2021 when the Jan. 6 riot occurred. Figures in recent years have remained largely elevated when contrasted with the 5,206 cases Capitol Police investigated just five years ago in 2018.

In Thursday's release, Capitol Police said that ""a wide range of threats and concerning statements"" had been directed at lawmakers from both political parties through various modes of communication including phone, social media, email, and others.

With the upcoming campaign season, the department is expecting 2024 to be ""a very busy year for our special agents,"" USCP Assistant Chief of Protective and Intelligence Operations Ashan M. Benedict said in a statement.

“Our team is dedicated to putting all of our resources into protecting the Congress while we continue to grow in order to keep up with our expanding mission,"" Benedict said.

In August last year, Capitol Police announced fresh efforts to shore up its recruitment of agents and investigators to protect members of Congress amid a wave of threats to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

A Nevada man was arrested and charged in October with leaving a series of antisemitic, profanity-laced voicemails at the office of Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., a prominent Jewish voice in support of Israel after Hamas’ attacks there.

That same month, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, said she received death threats and threatening phone calls after she cast her vote in a round of balloting for House speaker.

Earlier last year, a man was accused of attacking Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota in a Washington, D.C., elevator. He was sentenced in November to 27 months in prison.

E. Jean Carroll defamation

Expert: Repairing damage to E. Jean Carroll’s reputation would cost up to $12.1 million

Key players: U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll, Trump lawyer Alina Habba, Northwestern University marketing professor Ashlee Humphreys

On Thursday, Carroll’s lawyers called Humphreys to testify about the amount of money it would cost Carroll to repair the damage to her reputation caused by Trump’s attacks, the New York Daily News reported.

Using an analysis of Trump’s reach on social media platforms and the media coverage of his denials that he had sexually assaulted Carroll in 1996, Humphreys estimated that Trump’s claims had resulted in up to 104.1 million audience impressions. Undoing the resulting damage to Carroll’s reputation would, therefore, cost between $7.2 and $12.1 million, she testified.

The damage “was severe to her reputation as a journalist, and the costs to repair it are considerable,” Humphreys testified.

Trump’s lawyers argued that the former president’s remarks in the case had not been the cause of death threats Carroll received following the release of her memoir detailing Trump’s assault.

Carroll is suing Trump for $10 million in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount in punitive damages relating to the fact that Trump has continued to regularly defame her since the release of her 2019 memoir detailing her rape claims.

Prior to Humphreys taking the stand, Carroll faced cross examination from Habba, who tried to chip away at Carroll’s claim that Trump’s verbal attacks on her credibility had harmed her reputation and ability to make a living.

""No, my status was lowered,” Carroll testified. “I’m partaking in this trial to bring my old reputation and status back.”

She also told the jury that while she made as much as $400,000 a year as a journalist in the 1990s, and $60,000 a year in 2019 as a columnist for Elle magazine, she now earns roughly $100,000 a year from her posts on Substack.

Habba asked Carroll whether she was more “well-known” following Trump’s denials that he had assaulted Carroll than before, implying that notoriety had benefited her career.

""Yes, but I am hated by a lot more people,"" Carroll replied.

Trump, who clashed with Kaplan a day earlier, was not in the New York courtroom Thursday. Instead, he attended the funeral of his mother-in-law in Florida.

But jurors did hear from the former president Thursday. Carroll’s lawyers played a video clip of Trump addressing cameras yesterday in lower Manhattan, where he repeated his claims that he “never knew” Carroll and that her account about being assaulted in the changing room was “a made-up fabricated story.”

Trump is expected to testify in the case on Monday.

Why it matters: The case will decide how much more money Trump will be required to pay Carroll, if any. Because a jury has already found Trump liable for having sexually assaulted Carroll and ordered him to pay $5 million for defamatory comments made about her in 2022, he could soon find himself hit with a very costly verdict in the second trial.

Trump’s lawyers file Supreme Court brief on Colorado ballot ban

Key players: U.S. Supreme Court, Colorado Supreme Court

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers submitted a brief with the high court seeking a reversal of a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to ban Trump from state primary ballots on the grounds that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment bars him from holding office again, Reuters reported.

Section 3 states that no person who has “previously taken an oath” of office such as “an officer of the United States” who later “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” is allowed to hold office again.

“The Court should reverse the Colorado decision because President Trump is not even subject to section 3, as the President is not an ‘officer of the United States’ under the Constitution,” the brief filed Thursday states.

The brief continues: “And even if President Trump were subject to section 3 he did not ‘engage in’ anything that qualifies as ‘insurrection.’”

But a lower court judge in Colorado concluded the opposite.

Colorado’s Republican primary will be held on March 5.

The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Feb. 8.

On Thursday, more than 40 U.S. senators signed a brief to the Supreme Court asking it to keep Trump on state ballots in the face of 14th Amendment challenges.

Why it matters: The Supreme Court’s ultimate decision will impact rulings by the Colorado Supreme Court and Maine’s secretary of state on whether the Constitution bars Trump from holding office again.

Judge Lewis Kaplan warns former President Donald Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom if he continues to loudly comment on the testimony being given by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The rebuke comes after the judge in the second civil defamation lawsuit brought by Carroll had instructed Trump’s lawyers to have their client “keep his voice down” while Carroll testified. Trump, who is in court in New York Wednesday watching Carroll on the witness stand, could be heard commenting on her answers. Here are the latest legal developments surrounding the former president looking to be reelected to the White House in 2024.

E. Jean Carroll defamation

Judge warns Trump he can be tossed from courtroom

Key players: Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll, Trump lawyers Alina Habba and Michael Madaio, Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley

In a terse exchange Wednesday following a request by Kaplan to have Trump keep his voice down as Carroll testifies, the judge warned Trump that he could be removed from the courtroom.

“Mr. Trump has the right to be present here,” Kaplan said following another complaint by Crowley. “That right can be forfeited and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive, which what has been reported to me consists of. And if he disregards court orders, Mr. Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial.”

“I understand you’re probably eager for me to do that,” Kaplan added.

“I would love it,” Trump responded to the judge, according to court reporters.

Kaplan then replied: “I know you would. You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance apparently.”

Earlier, after Crowley complained that Trump could be heard “loudly saying things that are false” during Carroll’s testimony Wednesday in the second civil defamation trial against him, the judge addressed Trump’s lawyers, the Associated Press reported.

“I’m just going to ask Mr. Trump to take special care to keep his voice down when he’s conferring with counsel so that the jury does not overhear it,” Kaplan told Habba and Madaio.

As Carroll recounted for the jury how Trump “shattered” her reputation by repeatedly denying her allegation that Trump had raped her in the changing room of a New York department store in 1996, Trump was heard saying, “It’s false,” and other comments.

“I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and shattered my reputation,” Carroll testified.

“He lied last month. He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday. And I am here to get my reputation back,” Carroll added.

In May, a jury found that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll and later defamed her in 2022 by denying her account of the encounter that appeared in a memoir published in 2019. They awarded Carroll $5 million in damages.

The second trial concerns a statement issued by Trump in 2019, when he was president, alleging that Carroll made up the story to “sell a new book.”

Carroll testified that Trump’s statement set off a frenzy among his supporters that resulted in her receiving numerous death threats.

Carroll, whose lawyers noted in their opening statement that Trump continues to defame their client, is seeking an additional $10 million in compensatory damages, as well as millions more in punitive damages.

Why it matters: Kaplan has shown little patience with Trump’s courtroom theatrics nor his lawyers’ attempts to dismiss or delay the trial. The case is likely to wrap up early next week and may well prove very expensive for Trump.

In her opening statement Tuesday, E. Jean Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley tells the jury in former President Donald Trump’s second defamation trial that he “unleashed his followers to go after her” by continually denying her claim that he raped her in a department store changing room in the 1990s. Judge Lewis Kaplan tells prospective jurors “it has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll.” Here are the latest legal developments surrounding the former president who is seeking to be reelected to the White House in 2024.

E. Jean Carroll defamation

Trump ‘unleashed his followers to go after’ Carroll, her lawyer tells jury

Key players: Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll, Carroll attorney Shawn Crowley, Trump lawyer Alina Habba

In her opening statement Tuesday in the second civil defamation lawsuit brought against Trump, Crowley said the former president had “unleashed his followers to go after” Carroll “to threaten her life.”

“Donald Trump was president when he made those statements, and he used the world’s biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, humiliate her and to destroy her reputation,” Crowley told the jury in the case that will decide how much more money, if any, Trump will owe Carroll.

Crowley noted that even as Trump sat in the courtroom earlier in the day, defamatory messages continued to be posted to his social media account.

""How much money will it take to make him stop?"" Crowley asked the jury. ""He kept up those very same lies even after a federal jury sat in this courtroom and unanimously found that he sexually assaulted her and defamed her.""

On his Truth Social account Tueday morning, messages attributed to Trump called Carroll’s allegation that he raped her in a department store changing room in the mid-1990s “fabricated” and “attempted extortion,” the Associated Press reported.

Habba has said that the evidence in the case will show that Trump did not ruin Carroll’s reputation, and that she continued to find career success following the alleged attack.

Carroll, who in May was awarded $5 million by a jury, is seeking another $10 million in compensatory damages as well as millions more in punitive damages for defamatory remarks Trump made about Carroll in 2019, when he was president.

Trump left the courtroom Tuesday prior to opening statements. The judge has agreed to allow him to testify on Monday in the case, even though arguments are expected to conclude this week.

Why it matters: Because a jury already found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed Carroll, his continued assertions that she lied about the attack in a department store changing room open him up to further legal action.

Judge: ‘It has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll’

Key players: Judge Lewis Kaplan, columnist E. Jean Carroll

With Trump looking on during jury selection on Tuesday, Kaplan informed the prospective jurors in the civil lawsuit that the case before them would not revisit the question of whether Trump sexually assaulted Carroll in the mid-1990s in the changing room of a New York department store, ABC News reported.

“The court determined in a previous decision that Mr. Trump is liable for defamation,” Kaplan said. “For purposes of this trial it has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll, that he knew when he made these statements about Ms. Carroll ... that they were false or with reckless disregard.”

In May, a Manhattan jury ruled that Trump had assaulted Carroll and then defamed her in 2022 by claiming that the incident never happened

“This woman is not my type!” Trump wrote in a social media post calling Carroll’s claims “a hoax and a lie.”

The jury sided with Carroll and awarded her $5 million in damages.

The new case will determine whether comments Trump made in 2019, when he was president, also constituted defamation.

“She is trying to sell a new book — that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section. Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,” Trump said in the 2019 statement about Carroll’s account of the assault.

Kaplan also assured the jury pool that their identities would not be made public.

“Neither your names nor the names of the jurors who are ultimately selected nor any other identifying information will be made public,” Kaplan said.

Why it matters: With the earlier court decision, the question before the second jury is much more simple to decide. Kaplan has indicated that the trial could be over in a week’s time. Should the jury rule against Trump a second time, he could owe Carroll millions more in damages.

On Sunday, Daniels said on her podcast that she was “set to testify” in Trump’s hush money trial in New York that begins on March 25, CBS News reported.

""Obviously, things have been next-level crazy, since I am set to testify in, at this point in time, March — obviously, that can change at any moment — in the hush money case,"" Daniels said on the podcast.

Two civil cases against Trump have already been heard since he left the White House, and jury selection for a third will begin on Tuesday. The hush money trial is the first of four criminal cases that could be heard during the Republican presidential primary.

In March 2023, Trump made history by becoming the first former president to be indicted on criminal charges. He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to hide a payment to Daniels in 2016 for $130,000 that Daniels alleges was made to cover up an alleged extramarital affair that took place in 2006.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and denies that he ever had the affair with Daniels.

Daniels has detailed having sex with Trump in 2006 in a memoir titled Full Disclosure and in media interviews.

Cohen, who testified before the Manhattan grand jury about making the $130,000 payment to Daniels on Trump’s behalf, will also testify in the case.

Why it matters: Daniels will certainly be asked on the witness stand to revisit the details of the alleged affair with Trump. As this is a criminal trial, Trump will be required to be present for that testimony.

In a written filing, Trump's lawyers called on the court to reverse a first-of-its-kind Colorado Supreme Court decision that said Trump should not be on the state's Republican primary ballot because of his role in the events that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The justices are hearing arguments Feb. 8 in a case that both sides say needs to be resolved quickly so that voters know whether Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, is eligible to hold the presidency.

The court is dealing with the dispute under a compressed timeframe that could produce a decision before Super Tuesday on March 5, when the largest number of delegates are up for grabs in a single day, including in Colorado.

The case presents the high court with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some people who “engaged in insurrection” from holding public office. The amendment was adopted in 1868, following the Civil War.

Efforts to keep Trump off the ballot “threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and ... promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado’s lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots,” Trump's lawyers wrote.

Trump should win on many grounds, they wrote, including that he has not engaged in insurrection. “In fact, the opposite is true, as President Trump repeatedly called for peace, patriotism, and law and order,” the lawyers wrote.

The Colorado court noted that Trump had held a rally outside the White House and exhorted his supporters to “fight like hell” before they walked to the Capitol.

Trump's Supreme Court team is led by Texas-based lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, who devised aspects of the anti-abortion legislation that largely shut down abortions in Texas months before the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022.

Republican members of Congress, attorneys general and Republican legislative leaders in 27 states, and three former U.S. attorneys general, including one who served Trump, are among those who have weighed in to back him in the Colorado case.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Mike Johnson are among nearly 180 Republicans in Congress who have warned that a ruling upholding Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot would inevitably lead to tit-for-tat disqualifications of political opponents.

Colorado’s Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled last month that Trump should not be on the Republican primary ballot.

A two-sentence provision in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that anyone who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection” against it is no longer eligible for state or federal office. After Congress passed an amnesty for most of the former confederates the measure targeted in 1872, the provision fell into disuse until dozens of suits were filed to keep Trump off the ballot this year. Only the one in Colorado was successful.

Trump is separately appealing to state court a ruling by Maine’s Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, that he is ineligible to appear on that state’s ballot over his role in the Capitol attack. Both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Maine secretary of state’s rulings are on hold until the appeals play out.

The high court’s decision to intervene, which both sides have called for, is the most direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore in 2000, when a conservative majority effectively decided the election for Republican George W. Bush. Only Justice Clarence Thomas remains from that court.

Three of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Trump, though they have repeatedly ruled against him in 2020 election-related lawsuits, as well as on his efforts to keep documents related to Jan. 6 and his tax returns from being turned over to congressional committees.

The issue of whether Trump can be on the ballot is not the only matter related to the former president or Jan. 6 that has reached the high court. The justices last month declined a request from special counsel Jack Smith to swiftly take up and rule on Trump’s claims that he is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, though the issue could be back before the court soon depending on the ruling of a Washington-based appeals court.

And the court has said that it intends to hear an appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot, including against Trump.

(AP) — A North Dakota lawmaker who insulted police with vulgar, homophobic and anti-migrant comments during an arrest last month for drunken driving was sentenced to serve nearly a year of unsupervised probation and to pay $1,000.

Republican state Rep. Nico Rios, of Williston, received the sentence on Jan. 8, when he pleaded guilty to drunken driving, court records show. His sentence includes a 10-day suspended jail sentence, a mandatory evaluation and a victim impact panel. A misdemeanor charge of refusing a chemical test was dismissed. He must also pay $50 for an open container violation.

Text and email messages were sent to Rios seeking comment Thursday. A phone message was also left with his attorney.

Rios' sentence is consistent with others for similar offenses, said criminal defense attorney Mark Friese, a long-time practitioner in DUI cases. He noted that Rios' driving privileges will be suspended automatically for 91 days.

“It does not appear that he was treated more harshly than other people in similar situations,"" Friese said. “My guess is that the judge recognizes ... there are multiple entities here that are going to hold Mr. Rios to account.”

Police body-camera footage from the Dec. 15 traffic stop, requested by and provided to the AP, shows Rios cursing an officer, repeatedly questioning his English accent, and using homophobic slurs and anti-migrant language. He also said he would call the North Dakota attorney general about the situation. He told the officers they would “regret picking on me because you don’t know who ... I am.”

He has faced growing calls from his party to resign, including the House majority leader and state and local Republican Party officials.

Last week, Republican House Majority Leader Mike Lefor removed him from the Legislature's interim Judiciary Committee, saying it wouldn't be fair for law enforcement officers to testify in front of a committee of which Rios is a member. The House-Senate panel meets between legislative sessions for studies of topics related to law enforcement and the legal system for future or potential legislation.

Rios has said he is “seriously mulling all aspects” of his future, and plans to seek help for alcoholism, but he has made no plans to resign. He also previously said he takes responsibility for his “disgusting actions,"" and apologized “to those I have hurt and disappointed,"" including law enforcement officers.

Rios has said he was leaving a Christmas party before police pulled him over.

Rios, who works in an oil field position involved in the hydraulic fracturing of wells, was elected unopposed in 2022 to a four-year term in the state House of Representatives. Republicans control the House, 82-12.

US Navy ships spent months intercepting the Houthi attacks and warning them to stop to no avail.

Biden said that while the strikes on the militant group haven't deterred them, they will continue.

US forces operating near Yemen aren't waiting to respond to Houthi threats anymore and are hitting them before they are even launched, a new tactic aimed at putting greater pressure on the group.

The US previously spent months simply intercepting missiles and drones without a direct kinetic response against the Houthis. That changed last Thursday, but the shift doesn't appear to be deterring the Iranian-backed militant group.

On Thursday, reporters asked President Joe Biden if the strikes against Houthis are working.

""Well, when you say 'working,' are they stopping the Houthis? No,"" he said, referring to the strikes. ""Are they going to continue? Yes.""

President Biden says the United States will continue to conduct airstrikes against Ansar Allah (Houthis).

Since the US, in a coordinated multinational response with its allies and partners, launched a massive retaliatory strike on the Houthis directly last week as punishment for dozens of attacks on international shipping, US forces are now regularly targeting Houthi missiles on the ground directly rather than waiting around for the militant group to launch them.

On Thursday, US Central Command said it had ""conducted strikes on two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the South Red Sea and were prepared to launch.""

US forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and ""determined they were an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region,"" the press release read.

The previous day, a similar situation unfolded. CENTCOM said that it ""conducted strikes on 14 Iran-backed Houthi missiles that were loaded to be fired in Houthi controlled areas in Yemen.""

""These missiles on launch rails presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time, prompting US forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves,"" Wednesday's press release added.

And the day before that, CENTCOM said that American forces ""struck and destroyed four Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles"" that were ""prepared to launch from Houthi-controlled areas.""

In all of these cases, the US moved proactively, degrading Houthi forces, now redesignated as terrorists, by prioritizing striking first to neutralize missiles before they were launched.

Regardless of how this plays out, it's a notable shift for the US from how it and its allies have been handling the Houthis over the past few months.

Houthis' attacks, which began in direct response to the Israel-Hamas war but escalated, have forced global shipping operations to reroute vessels, driving up cost and time.

The US, which had already been intercepting threats, took steps in mid-December to restore navigation in the area through coalition action, but Houthi attacks continued. By early January, the US and more than a dozen allies issued a statement condemning the Houthis and demanding an immediate end to their attacks.

The statement said that ""the Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways.""

Shortly after, the Houthis launched their largest-ever attack, which CENTCOM said included 18 one-way attack drones, two anti-ship cruise missiles, and one anti-ship ballistic missile.

Western officials continued to warn against the attacks until last Thursday, when the US and UK conducted widespread attacks targeting dozens of Houthi assets across Yemen, including radar stations, weapons storage, launch sites, command, and production facilities.

Since last week, the US has conducted five direct strikes on the Houthis. And as Biden said, the strikes are expected to continue. A Pentagon spokesperson told media this afternoon that it's up to the Houthis when this ends.

The House Oversight Committee announced Thursday that the two parties have agreed for Hunter Biden to sit for a deposition on Feb. 28.

“The president’s son is a key witness in this investigation and he’s gonna be able to come in now and sit down and answer questions in a substantive, orderly manner,” Rep. James Comer, chair of the Oversight Committee, told reporters. He added that Hunter Biden will be able to testify publicly sometime after his deposition.

News of the agreement was confirmed by Hunter Biden's legal team Thursday night.

Republicans had been set to advance a contempt resolution against him to the House floor this week but called it off Tuesday to give the attorneys additional time to negotiate. If they had voted on the contempt resolution, the referral would have been sent to the Justice Department where the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia would have had to decide whether to prosecute Hunter Biden.

The agreement concludes months of contentious back-and-forth between President Joe Biden's son and Republicans who have been investigating his overseas business dealings for over a year in a so far futile effort to connect it to his father.

Republicans, led by Comer and Jordan, first subpoenaed the younger Biden in November, demanding that he appear before lawmakers in a private setting by mid-December. Biden and his attorneys refused to comply with the private interview, saying that it would allow information to be selectively leaked and manipulated by House Republicans and insisted that he would only testify in a public setting.

When Republicans denied those terms, Hunter Biden and his attorneys made two separate appearances at the U.S. Capitol, further angering congressional investigators. In both instances, Biden again refused to testify privately, instead delivering statements to the press where he defended his business affairs and castigated the yearslong investigations into him and his family.

“There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business because it did not happen,” the president’s son said in remarks outside the Capitol in December.

He added, “There is no fairness or decency in what these Republicans are doing — they have lied over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life — so much so that their lies have become the false facts believed by too many people.

But Hunter Biden and his legal team appeared to shift gears late last week when they sent a letter to Comer and Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, indicating a willingness for the first time to come in for a private deposition.

Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's attorney, wrote in a letter Friday that his client's cooperation is dependent on the committee issuing a new subpoena, which they will now do given the updated deposition date. They had argued that the two subpoenas sent in last year were not legitimate because they were issued before the full House authorized the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

The impeachment inquiry into the president, which began in September, has focused heavily on Hunter Biden and his international business affairs, questioning whether the president profited from that work. It has so far failed to uncover evidence directly implicating Joe Biden in wrongdoing involving his son’s work.

Meanwhile, Hunter Biden is currently facing criminal charges in two states from the special counsel investigation. He’s charged with firearm counts in Delaware, alleging he broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. Special counsel David Weiss filed additional charges last month, alleging he failed to pay about $1.4 million in taxes over three years.

He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.

In one of several interviews with POLITICO, Steve Garvey, a former professional baseball player and first-time political candidate, wouldn’t even rule out voting for President Joe Biden as he sought to distance himself from Trump.

“Nobody’s out of bounds because I’m looking at each individual soul separately,” Garvey said when asked who he was considering supporting for president.

He said he would “absolutely” vote for a candidate for the opposing party, depending on who else is on the ballot.

“I’ve voted for Democrats,” Garvey said Wednesday as he made his first statewide tour as a candidate for the seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

His apparent willingness to cross party lines — and neither endorse Trump nor seek the former president’s support — would be heresy for a Republican in much of the country. But it makes sense in California for a general election, where the party now claims only a quarter of the electorate and where a GOP candidate hasn’t been elected to a statewide office since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor in 2006.

The strategy also makes sense because of the state's primary system, in which the top two candidates, regardless of party, advance to the runoff in November. Garvey, who is running against three veteran Democratic members of Congress, needs every Republican vote he can get, along with independents and moderates.

His unwillingness to embrace Trump, however, risks alienating passionate supporters of the former president who are expected to turn out for the primary in March.

“Republican math is basically impossible in California, so if you’re going to break through you have to create a new formula,” GOP strategist Rob Stutzman said.

As Stutzman sees it, Garvey pretty much needs every Republican voter, some moderate Democrats and to “dominate” independents to stand a chance.

Garvey said he was not “consciously distancing” himself from Trump, noting that he likes some of the former president’s policies but does not always agree with how he gets his message across.

He said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

“Do I think that the most dangerous disease next to Covid is Trump syndrome? Yes,” Garvey added, a reference to the media’s coverage of the former president.

At a Thursday meeting with Jewish leaders in the Bay Area city of Pleasanton, Garvey said he was not expecting a Trump endorsement — but wouldn’t say whether he would accept one either.

""I'm more concerned about the single most difficult race in America right now for a conservative moderate like myself,” Garvey said. “I don't have time to worry about him.""

While Stutzman says Garvey has the chance to ride his Trump agnosticism through the March 5 primary, he’ll have to pony up more policy positions and ad money to stand any chance in the general.

“He needs to keep a distance from Trump. But he can’t vote for Biden. And that could work for the primary,” Stutzman said, adding that Garvey needs to spend around $4-6 million in advertising to cushion his chances in March.

Beyond the spring, the road gets rockier. “If he can make the runoff, I think it’ll be very difficult. There’s a lot about Mr. Garvey that we don’t know yet. He’s not being specific about issues yet, but will have to be in the general,” Stutzman said.

Pressed on the presidential primary, Garvey dodged the question, saying he’s only interested in his own race.

“I’m going to vote for Steve Garvey,” he said. “The former president is not on my ballot. Joe Biden is not on my ballot.”

Garvey will go head-to-head with his Democratic rivals, Reps. Katie Porter, Barbara Lee and Adam Schiff, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday in Los Angeles. The first California Senate debate will air live on FOX 11 in Los Angeles, KTVU FOX 2 in the San Francisco Bay Area and will be livestreamed on POLITICO.

More Democrats than Republicans voted for it — the 4th time this has happened for must-pass bills.

Despite controlling the House, GOP leaders have consistently had to rely on Democratic votes.

The House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday evening that temporarily extends government funding — and way more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.

If that sounds familiar, that's because it's the fourth time something like it has happened this year — even though Republicans technically control the chamber by a slim margin.

""It does not matter who's sitting in the speaker's seat, or who's holding the majority,"" an angry Rep. Chip Roy of Texas declared in a floor speech ahead of the vote. ""We keep doing the same stupid stuff.""

The short-term funding bill, negotiated in part by House Speaker Mike Johnson, passed 314-108, with 207 Democrats and 107 Republicans voting for it.

106 Republicans voted against it, while just 2 Democrats did the same.

Having easily passed the Senate earlier on Thursday, the bill now heads to President Joe Biden's desk ahead what would have been a partial government shutdown on Saturday.

And it passed despite last-minute right-wing gripes, with members of the House Freedom Caucus and others trying to attach hardline immigration policies to the must-pass bill.

The right flank of the GOP conference has increasingly fumed at Johnson in much the same way they did at McCarthy, accusing him of not using must-pass bills to advance their hardline priorities — even as Democrats continue to hold the Senate and the White House.

Lawmakers now face two deadlines — March 1 and March 8 — to fund the entirety of the government for the rest of the year.

Democrats keep shouldering more of the burden of governing than Republicans

In the year since Republicans assumed control of the House — and particularly since the summer — chaos and lack of productivity have been major overarching themes.

Torn between mainstream members and hardliners who hope to enact sweeping right-wing policy changes, Republicans have often shown themselves unable to handle must-pass legislation without the help of Democrats.

The first time this dynamic came into view was at the very end of May, when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated a bill to raise the debt limit through the 2024 election. Breaching the debt limit would have led to a default on the country's debt, triggering a widespread fiscal crisis.

The House passed that bill by a 314-117 margin, with 165 Democrats and 149 Republicans voting for it. At that point, the discrepancy wasn't that great — there were aspects of the deal that Democrats disliked, and the same was true of Republicans.

Then came the end of September.

Facing a government funding deadline — aka, a possible government shutdown — McCarthy put forward a bill that would fund the government for another two months.

It passed by a 335-91 margin, with 209 Democrats and 126 Republicans voting for it. Put another way: Every vote against funding the government came from Republicans, except for one.

That vote ended up being the straw that broke the camel's back: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida forced a vote to oust McCarthy the following week, and the House was thrown into chaos for most of October.

Having squandered half of the time that they'd given themselves to pass government funding bills, the House was forced to pass another short-term continuing resolution in November, but with a twist: It would be a ""laddered,"" giving lawmakers two deadlines roughly a week apart for different parts of the federal government.

That bill passed 336-95, with 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans voting for it. Just 2 Democrats were among the opposition.

Johnson, then still brand new, was given some grace by hardliners, even though McCarthy had just been ousted for doing the same thing: putting a clean extension of government funding up for a vote.

But this time, the Louisiana Republican faced simmering and vocal anger from the right, with some even alluding to a potential vote to oust him.

""Our Speaker, Mr. Johnson, said he was the most conservative speaker we've ever had, and yet here we are, putting this bill on the floor,"" said. Rep.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) scorched Donald Trump on Wednesday for his role in getting Roe v. Wade overturned, saying the former president is the reason “abortion will be on the ballot in 2024.”

“He proudly put this Supreme Court in place,” Warren told MSNBC’s Alex Wagner. “He proudly screened them for their position on abortion. And he is responsible for the state of abortion in this country right now.”

Trump, who won Iowa’s GOP caucuses this week and leads the pack for the Republican presidential nomination, is still boasting about his role in packing the U.S. Supreme Court with abortion opponents, leading to the downfall of federal reproductive rights protections in 2022.

Warren predicted that if Republicans win big in November, the procedure could become completely inaccessible nationwide.

“If the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House ― and please, no ― but if that happened, I don’t think there’s any doubt they’re going for a nationwide abortion ban,” she said. “They’ve made that clear.”

“Abortion will be on the ballot in 2024,” Warren promised.

She listed some of the grim events that have arisen in the U.S. since the fall of Roe.

“A 10-year-old who needs an abortion and can’t get it in her state,” Warren said. “A mother who desperately wants a baby, but understands that this fetus in her is badly deformed and she needs an abortion. Another mother, whose life is at risk, and doctors stand beside her saying, ‘Is she close enough to death for us to give her an abortion under local laws?’ So, it’s watching the reality unfold [a] piece at a time.”

Lawmakers have made abortion illegal in 14 states over the past 18 months. But voters have repeatedly upheld access to the procedure in places where it’s landed on the ballot ― even in deep red states and swing states, from Kansas and Kentucky to Ohio and Michigan.

Polls show that a majority of Americans support some degree of access to abortion. In a 2023 Gallup poll, a record-high 69% of people said abortion should generally be legal during the first three months of pregnancy, and 52% said abortion is morally acceptable.

House Republicans are making the bill a priority, and the chairman of the House Budget Committee said “everything's on the table” regarding possible action to slow the federal government's increasing level of debt, now at more than $34 trillion. Many Democrats see the commission as an attempt to force cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

The bill, approved by the GOP-majority committee by a 22-12 vote, would ask the commission to recommend ways to balance the budget at the earliest reasonable date and to improve the long-term solvency of Medicare, Social Security and other programs paid for through trust funds. The commission would have 16 members: 12 from Congress, evenly divided by party, and four outside experts who would not have voting power.

Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, have sponsored a companion measure in the Senate.

Similar commissions have succeeded in the past, but recent ones have mostly failed due to partisan divisions. Republicans blame federal spending for the annual deficits while many Democrats cite tax cuts enacted under Republican administrations. That divide was again on display during debate Thursday, raising doubts about whether a new commission could make any headway.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, the committee chairman, said both parties are guilty of not being responsible fiscal stewards. He said the yearly struggles to pass spending bills show a broken process that makes it hard to address the country's financial challenges.

“We all own this,” said Arrington, R-Texas. “We're all in this boat together. The boat is sinking.”

The committee's top Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, said he fears that some lawmakers want to use the commission “as a backdoor way to force through unpopular cuts.” He said Congress needs to have the courage to increase the revenues going into Social Security and Medicare, which would put both programs on firm financial footing for decades ahead.

“We don't need a commission to do that,” he said.

The hearing began with a protester being led away by U.S. Capitol Police while yelling “no cuts to Social Security, no cuts to Social Security.” Some 116 House Democrats wrote a letter last week to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, opposing the bill and calling it “a direct circumvention of the process to expedite cuts to Social Security.”

Johnson praised the committee's vote, calling it “a positive step towards fiscal sanity.” Jeffries said before the vote he would evaluate the proposal after it got out of committee and that he supported various Democratic amendments that were to be offered to the bill. In the end, those Democratic amendments were rejected.

“If it's not clear that Social Security and Medicare are protected, then it will be my expectation that there will be a lukewarm response at best when it hits the floor,” Jeffries said.

Some Democrats do support the establishment of the debt commission. Three committee Democrats voted for it, including Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., who worked with Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich. in sponsoring the bill. Peters said cuts to Social Security are already factored into current law and once the program exhaust its reserves in less than a decade, then participants would see their benefits cut by about 24%.

“Whether you're 72 or 92, rich or poor, you're going to get cut,” Peters said. “Now, we can pretend that doing nothing is going to solve the problem. We can pretend that regular order is going to take care of it. I choose to offer a different path.”

He said he wants to save the program and not cut benefits, but the longer Congress waits to tackle the problem, “the more leverage we give to the people who want to cut benefits.”

Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said she is concerned when she hears Arrington say “everything is on the table” for the commission.

""There are some things that should absolutely not be on the table, and that's because the wealth gap in this country is obscene,” she said.

The commission would be required to hold at least six hearings across the country. A final report and recommendations would be due by May 2025, Arrington said. The recommendations would get an expedited vote in Congress if they win the approval of a majority of the commission, including at least two members of each party.

Earlier this month, attorneys for Trump asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to hold Smith in contempt for filing motions while the case is stayed pending Trump’s appeal on presidential immunity grounds.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia)

Chutkan, however, said in her opinion and order Thursday that she agrees with Trump that Smith’s filings place a ""cognizable"" burden on him, and that although it was ""not a major burden"" for Trump's team to have to review Smith's filings, and that she would now forbid the special counsel from making substantive pretrial motions without permission going forward.

Chutkan has ordered that both parties be required to seek her permission before filing additional pre-trial motions while the stay order remains in effect.

“This measure is an addition to the Stay Order, aimed to further advance its purposes, and does not reflect a determination that the Government has violated any of its clear and unambiguous terms or acted in bad faith,” she wrote.

Chutkan wrote that continuing to produce discovery was a separate matter, and that she ""cannot conclude that merely receiving discovery or an exhibit list constitutes a meaningful burden,"" because receiving discovery ""requires no review or response"" from Trump's team.

Smith's office had explicitly notified both the court and Trump's team that it planned to continue to meet the deadlines previously set by the court. In a memo opposing Trump's motion to hold the special counsel in contempt, Smith's office noted that the office ""did what it said it would do.""

Chutkan noted in her order that Smith's office was factually correct: Her motion did not forbid the special counsel from continuing to meet deadlines.

""On its own terms, then, the Stay Order’s key operative sentence did not clearly bar the Government from voluntary rather than obligatory compliance with the Pretrial Order’s now-stayed deadlines,"" Chutkan wrote.

Trump had filed a motion that contended that the federal government violated a court order by continuing to produce discovery in the case and filing a motion while the case was paused as an appeals court considers Trump's effort to dismiss the case based on presidential immunity grounds.

The motion earlier this month came from Trump lawyer John Lauro who argued that Smith should be held in contempt for an “unlawful” production of discovery and said that federal prosecutors are engaging in “partisan-driven misconduct.”

Chutkan's opinion Thursday noted that even after she stayed the case on Dec. 13, Smith's office produced additional discovery and a draft exhibit list to Trump's legal team as well as a motion seeking to exclude certain evidence and arguments from any trial in the case.

Trump is waiting for a ruling by a federal appeals court in a case in which he argues that he's immune from being prosecuted over his election interference efforts because he was president at the time. The case is likely to end up in front of the Supreme Court.

The trial in the election case is scheduled to begin on March 4, though Chutkan suggested in her order it could be delayed as these legal matters are considered by the courts.

""Contrary to Defendant’s assertion, the court has not and will not set deadlines in this case based on the assumption that he has undertaken preparations when not required to do so,"" she wrote.

She then quoted a prior statement she made in which she said seven months would be “sufficient time” to prepare for trial, suggesting that an additional few weeks could be added since the case has been paused since December.

""There are some that are saying, 'Hey, we don't want Biden to actually get credit for doing anything on the border,"" Sen. James Lankford said.

Lankford has helped lead negotiations over a trade off of tougher immigration laws in exchange for Ukraine aid.

Republican Sen. James Lankford, the leading GOP lawmaker on bipartisan immigration talks, said that some conservatives want to tank a potential deal over concern that it could hand President Joe Biden a political win.

""There are some that are saying, 'Hey, we don't want Biden to actually get credit for doing anything on the border, because obviously, he's made a huge mess,"" Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, told The Washington Post.

Lankford has been at the center of months-long talks that would pair President Joe Biden's request for Ukraine aid with stricter immigration enforcement. Biden asked top leaders to come to the White House earlier this week as he pressed them on the urgency of getting Ukraine more military funds for its war against Russia.

The possibility that the talks might be tanked to try to hurt Biden's reelection chances are just another reminder that November's presidential election is rapidly approaching. Polling also shows that Americans are deeply unimpressed with the current situation at the Southern border. In December, federal officials recorded the highest number of illegal border crossings ever in a single month period.

Republicans have described the border as a national security disaster, raising the question why they may scuttle a deal that could give them some of the changes they are seeking.

The politics of the situation are incredibly dicey.

Conservatives and President Donald Trump have expressed skepticism about a possible Senate-led deal.

""I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions & Millions of people, many from parts unknown, into our once great, but soon to be great again, Country,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth, Wednesday evening.

Many of the skeptics have pointed to the possibility that November's elections could hand Republicans control of Washington. Some House Republicans have said that they want to see their immigration law changes, known as HR-2, in a final deal, a request that would be a non-starter in the Senate given how conservative the House legislation is compared to current law.

House Speaker Mike Johnson can't afford to greater anger conservative lawmakers, whom he needs to hold his narrow majority together especially ahead of potential limited government shutdowns.

On the left, some Democratic lawmakers are skeptical of the talks. Immigration rights advocates have pointed out that none of the discussions have included pathway to citizenship or protections for so-called Dreamers would be unprecedented. Historically, tougher border enforcement has been paired with more protections for the millions of undocumented migrants already in the US.

CONCORD, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Donald Trump and his allies are going all out to deal Republican rival Nikki Haley a back-breaking blow in next week’s New Hampshire primary, courting her donors, bashing her in TV ads and using racial-themed dog whistles that mock her heritage.

The multi-pronged effort is a sure sign that Trump’s presidential election campaign views Haley as a threat they must neutralize quickly. Trump associates have been reaching out to Haley’s top contributors, telling them the race for the Republican nomination is essentially over and suggesting it is time to come into the fold.

""I get calls all the time,"" said Fred Zeidman, a longtime Haley fundraiser from Texas who said Trump’s allies tell him: ""'We're going to win. You’re going to lose. Don’t you want to be on the right team?'""

Zeidman said his response is that Haley can win. ""Why would I get out now?"" he said. ""She's doing everything she needs to do.""

The fast winnowing of the Republican field has left New Hampshire as basically a two-candidate race between Trump, the former president, and Haley, who once served as his ambassador to the United Nations.

Polls show the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23 to be competitive, largely because Haley draws support from establishment Republicans, moderates, suburbanites and independents, who are permitted to vote in the primary. Trump continues to dominate among hard-core conservatives and working-class voters.

Trump's campaign did not respond to inquiries about strategy, but it appears clear the goal is to ensure Haley leaves New Hampshire with little momentum as the fight turns next month to South Carolina, where she served two terms as governor.

Andy Sabin, a metals magnate and Haley backer, said he, too, has been contacted by Trump’s allies but isn't ready to jump.

""I don't know in my heart if I can give (Trump) financial support. I just have to be in the mood. And I'm not,” Sabin said. ""I can’t like him as a person. I can't find him likeable. But I do find he was a good president.""

AD BLITZ

Trump and his forces have stepped up attacks on Haley at campaign events and on television.

At a rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire this week, Trump called Haley a “disaster” and belittled her foreign policy credentials.

“She was not a good negotiator,” he said. “She likes to talk about how (she) negotiated with China. I negotiated with China.”

Trump’s campaign is now deploying former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who was sharply critical of Haley in debates, to continue his attacks against her at Trump events.

In a campaign memo earlier this month, Trump’s campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles slammed Haley as a phony Republican who would be forced to cobble together a coalition of “non-Republicans and Democrats” to compete.

Between December and January, spending by a top Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., on negative Haley TV ads jumped from almost $1.6 million to roughly $2.8 million, for a total of almost $4.4 million over the two months, according to data from AdImpact.

One MAGA Inc. ad accuses Haley of being soft on border security, saying she opposed the building of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

The Trump campaign is running TV ads telling voters that Haley seeks to cut Medicare and Social Security benefits, an attack typically used by Democratic candidates against Republicans.

At a rally on Wednesday in Rochester, New Hampshire, Haley made a point of saying such attacks were false. She said she would seek to reform the benefit programs. She defended her immigration record, contending she has always supported the wall.

""Just because you see a commercial...it's not true. I know Trump threw a temper tantrum about me last night, and I have seen the commercials you've seen,"" she said at the rally. ""I will always tell you the truth.""

NAME CALLING

Trump has also begun to mock Haley’s background in the same way he has done with other women politicians of color such as Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Truth Social post attacking Haley on Tuesday, Trump referred to her as “Nimrada” – a misspelling of her given first name, Nimarata, saying she had given a “wacked out” speech in Iowa, where she came in a distant third this week behind Trump.

Haley, the daughter of two immigrants from India, was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa and later took her husband’s surname. She has long used her middle name Nikki.

As of Thursday, Trump's post had received more than 17,000 likes and been “re-truthed” over 4,000 times.

A Reuters review of references to “Nimarata” and variations of the name's spelling on social media platforms shows that the name has been appearing in critical Haley posts since November.

Reuters saw an uptick in those references in December, after Haley failed to mention slavery in her response to a New Hampshire town hall question about the reason for the Civil War – comments she subsequently walked back.

Since Trump’s commanding win in the Iowa caucuses, another dynamic has emerged: Donors who want to get in Trump’s good graces as he heads toward capturing the nomination to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in the November general election.

Trump fundraiser Ed McMullen, a former ambassador to Switzerland, said DeSantis and Haley donors were now reaching out to him.

He said more than 50 donors had called him in the last week wanting to join Trump, with about 60% of them formerly with DeSantis and 30% with Haley.

""Iowa is the catalyzing event that awakened people that it’s time to get on board,"" McMullen said.

Another Republican donor, who asked to remain unidentified, said that after Trump's Iowa victory, he has been asked to come to a face-to-face meeting with Trump at his Florida estate.

""Since Iowa, the calls have ramped up,"" the donor said. ""They say: 'Come down to Mar-a-Lago, let us give you 15 minutes with Trump. Let's put all this behind us and let’s focus on beating Biden.'""

The donor said he was turning down the requests for now, but added: ""I'll be wearing a MAGA hat by summer.""

""Well, I don't think Iowa means anything,” Biden told reporters Thursday, when asked about the implications of Trump’s victory for his own reelection efforts.

“The president got 50-some-thousand votes, the lowest number of votes anybody who's won got. You know, this idea that he's going to run away, he can think anyway he wants, let him make that judgment,” Biden said.

The former president won less than 57,000 votes on Monday, during a caucus in which turnout was hampered by record-breaking low temperatures, days of blizzard conditions and a generally uncompetitive race in the state.


While other Iowa winners have gotten far less numerical votes than Trump in contests with more competitive fields — Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) won the 2016 caucuses with 52,000 votes, which accounted for roughly 28 percent of the vote, for example — turnout was very low earlier this week.

According to The Des Moines Register, the 110,000 voters who came out to caucus represented just 15 percent of Iowa’s registered Republicans. Turnout was the lowest it’s been in a GOP presidential primary in 24 years, according to Business Insider.

Trump, however, handily defeated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won just over 21 percent of the vote, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who came in with slightly over 19 percent.

With Trump still crushing his Republican opponents in national polls and Biden dominating a Democratic field that includes Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, the pair appear to be headed for a rematch in November.

Trump, Haley and DeSantis will all appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot on Tuesday. Biden will not be on the ballot in the Granite State next week — although his allies have launched a write-in effort to hand him a win there anyway.

After correcting the gaffe within a day, Nick Wilson – a Republican representative in Kentucky’s house of representatives – expressed hope that the misstep would not doom a measure whose purpose is to combat familial abuse.

Wilson told the Guardian on Thursday that the entire episode was “frustrating” and “embarrassing”.

“Due to the subject matter of the legislation, it was obviously quite embarrassing,” Wilson said. “It was also frustrating that it blew up so quickly, just because I was on a TV show five years ago.

“I didn’t get a chance to fix the mistake – not even one day. I feel like most legislators would get that opportunity.”

Wilson introduced a bill on Tuesday which in effect proposed removing first cousins from a list of unlawful incestuous relationships.

A fierce backlash met the move quickly after a New York public defender and fellow Survivor alum, Eliza Orlins, went on TikTok to condemn Wilson’s proposal.

“Kentucky – like so many other places – is facing a lot of issues, and this is Nick’s top legislative priority,” Orlins said. “No matter what Nick’s weird priorities are, your voices matter, and when your voices are heard, it actually has an impact in local politics.”

After wishing a great day to her TikTok audience, she addressed Wilson directly. “Nick Wilson, I hope you have the day that you deserve,” she said.

Wilson subsequently reversed course and said it was an unintentional “mistake” to have omitted first cousins from a list of relationships that Kentucky law defined as incestuous if they involved sex.

“During the drafting process [of the bill], there was an inadvertent change, which struck ‘first cousins’ from the list of relationships included under the incest statute, and I failed to add it back in,” Wilson said in a statement. “During today’s session, I will withdraw [the measure] and refile a bill with the ‘first cousin’ language intact.”

Many US states, including Kentucky, outright prohibit marriages between first cousins, while 19 states and the District of Columbia allow such a union. Some states, like Arizona and Maine, allow marriages between first cousins with certain exceptions.

The commonwealth of Kentucky defines incest as: “deviate sexual intercourse [or] sexual contact with a person whom he or she knows to be his or her parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, great-grandparent, great-grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, brother, sister, first cousin, ancestor, or descendant”.

Wilson has since refiled the measure as house bill 289. And in addition to sexual intercourse, the measure adds “sexual contact” to the definition of incest.

The reintroduced bill also adds incest to the violent offender statute.

Wilson said his new bill made no other changes to current law.

After making changes to the bill, Wilson said: “This is a bill to combat a problem of familial and cyclical abuse that transcends generations of Kentuckians. I understand that I made a mistake, but I sincerely hope my mistake doesn’t hurt the chances of the corrected version of the bill. It is a good bill, and I hope it will get a second chance.”

Wilson also told the Guardian that he hoped the scrutiny he encountered leads to more awareness surrounding the issue of sexual abuse within family homes.

“There have been many foster parents and survivors of sexual abuse reach out to me to thank me for pursuing this change in law,” Wilson said. “The amount of hopefulness I get from those calls and emails are much greater than any feelings of embarrassment or frustration that I’ve experienced in the past two days.”

Wilson was previously a public defender and in 2022 ran unopposed for the state house representing its 82nd district. He competed in the reality TV show Survivor in 2018 and 2020 and was the competition’s champion in its 37th season.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), new champion for maternity leave proxy voting in Congress, told a committee witness she wants migrants separated from children they travel with.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/3645906be08670f404a3d8f3abea3a6f,"On Tuesday, freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) introduced a bill allowing House members to cast votes on behalf of new mothers unable to attend Congress in person, giving the mothers time to recover and be with their newborns without the hassle of traveling to Washington for work.

On Wednesday, in a tense exchange with a witness at a committee hearing, Luna said she wanted migrants claiming asylum at the U.S. border to be at least temporarily separated from any children who accompany them.

“The reason why we want family separation, until we can confirm if they are the actual biological parents, is because these kids are being trafficked,” she said at a House oversight hearing on immigration.

The witness, David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, had said the Donald Trump administration had engaged in unnecessary “psychological torture of children” with its family separation policy. He challenged Luna’s assertion of widespread child trafficking by people posing as young migrants’ parents, which led to the exchange.

Luna doubled down later in the day on her comment, saying in a video posted on social media she did not make apologies for endorsing the family separation policy even though it “triggered a lot of people.”

“I’m sorry that we’re breaking through your programming, but the fact is family separation and biological confirmation saves lives,” she said.

Just a day before the hearing, Luna introduced H. Res. 967, which would change the rules of the House to allow members who had given birth up to six weeks afterwards to vote by proxy.

At a press conference Thursday, Luna didn’t answer directly when asked if she saw any contradiction in her stances.

“I think we need to focus on the maternity vote by proxy,” she said.

“What I can tell you is I don’t make any apologies for that statement,” she said of the family separation dustup. “I would absolutely rather have my child confirmed that that’s my biological child if someone was claiming to be their parent.”

House Republicans strenuously opposed proxy voting when it was instituted by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as a safety measure.

But Luna, who gave birth to a son named George Henry in August, told the New York Times her perspective had changed in part because of post-pregnancy medical complications that kept her from being able to travel for a while.

“You’re being forced to choose between your career and having a family,” she said.

On Thursday, she said the bill should get bipartisan support, with Democrats being “pro-women” and Republicans being “pro-family,” but said both sides have reservations.

“We champion pro-life and and pro-family values, but there’s some hesitancy I think on supporting it,” she said.

Luna’s bill had drawn 24 co-sponsors as of Thursday. Only four were Republicans, however, and two of those were women, Reps. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) and Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.).

Fearing a backlash from the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision allowing states to restrict abortion access, Republicans are trying to emphasize their family-friendly credentials ahead of November.

“We want to make it easier for working mothers and moms and dads to start and raise a family,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said at a press conference on Wednesday.

Luna herself leaned into her own new role in her back-and-forth at Wednesday’s hearing.

When Beir started to challenge her by saying, “As a father,” Luna cut him off.

“I’m a mother,” she said. “We can go back and forth.”

Nikki Haley took the stage at Hampshire Hills Athletic Club in Milford, New Hampshire, in early January, two state Republicans who had openly quarreled a year earlier over whether the 2020 election had been stolen from former President Donald Trump rallied the crowd in her support.

Retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, a veteran of 10 tours in Afghanistan and one of Haley's first endorsements, was the first to speak, touted Haley's support of his failed 2022 Senate run and explained why he signed on to be her New Hampshire campaign chair.

Who's running for president in 2024? Meet the candidates — and the ones who've dropped out

""She was a mentor to me, and I realized I was making a lot of mistakes,"" Bolduc admitted to the audience of over 700. ""It was made clear by a lot of people while I was running, 'The guy's not a politician.'""

New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu endorsed Haley in mid-December and has taken her around the state in hopes of defeating Trump in the state's first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23.

""As the general said, [Haley is] the opportunity to get behind a candidate that unifies everybody together, that next generation of conservative leadership,"" Sununu told the crowd packed onto the basketball court in the athletic club.

New Hampshire's open primary allows undeclared voters, who make up about 40% of the state's voting bloc, to participate in either party's primary election. It means Haley's path to victory depends on her appeal to that group, as well as the state's conservative base, which makes up about 30% of registered voters in New Hampshire.

A seminal moment in Bolduc's 2022 race was his flip-flop over whether he believed the election had been stolen from Trump, an opinion shared by 19 other 2022 GOP Senate candidates, according to a CBS News analysis.

""I signed a letter with 120 other generals and admirals saying that Donald Trump won the election and, damn it, I stand by [it], Bolduc said in an August 2022 debate against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan.

""I'm not switching horses, baby. This is it,"" he added.

But weeks later, Bolduc backtracked, saying on Fox News that after he had ""done a lot of research,"" he had come to the ""definitive"" conclusion that ""the election was not stolen,"" though he claimed there was still fraud.

Haley's comments about her support for election deniers have not always been accurate. In a 2022 interview with the ""Today"" show, she said that she would not campaign for candidates who had denied the results of the 2020 election.

""Everybody that I'm helping acknowledges the fact that the elections, you know, were real,"" Haley said.

However, Haley had campaigned for Bolduc both before and after his remarks claiming Trump had won the election. She also campaigned for or endorsed other GOP Senate candidates who cast doubt on the results of the 2020 election: Adam Laxalt of Nevada, Herschel Walker of Georgia, Mehmet Oz of Pennsylvania and Ted Budd of North Carolina. Only Budd ultimately won his race.

Sununu was one of Bolduc's most vocal critics, calling him a ""conspiracy-theorist-type candidate."" In the Senate Republican primary, Sununu backed Bolduc's challenger in the race, Chuck Morse.

In response, Bolduc called Sununu a ""Chinese Communist sympathizer."" But after Bolduc won the primary, Sununu eventually supported him in the general election.

""Governor Sununu and I agreed that the comments we made about the 2022 race were put to bed at the Republican breakfast after the [2022] primary,"" Bolduc wrote in a text message to CBS News. ""We both agreed that campaigns get sporty, things get said, and when the dust settles we must unite for the greater good.""

The Haley campaign has touted the endorsements of both men, featuring them in separate ads in recent weeks. Sununu is a popular governor who won reelection in 2022, decisively winning traditionally Democratic areas like Manchester, Nashua and Merrimack, as well as the Republican-leaning parts of the state.

Haley, for her part, has sought to appeal to both independents and Republicans on issues like abortion, mentioning the need to find a national ""consensus"" on an abortion ban, but also pledging to not judge anyone for being pro-abortion rights.

Trump won the 2016 GOP primary in New Hampshire and he lost the state by less than 3,000 votes in the general election, although President Biden had a more decisive victory of nearly 50,000 votes in the state in 2020. Trump leads recent polls for the GOP primary this year, but Bolduc and Sununu both hope voters across the state are ready to move on in the name of selecting a unifying nominee.

Bolduc's involvement in Haley's campaign isn't without risk. A longtime New Hampshire political operative told CBS News he was polled via text by the Haley campaign on Bolduc's favorables, suggesting that Haley's team has some concerns about Bolduc's appeal to GOP primary voters, particularly independents.

""I wonder if they've calculated the paradoxical effect of Bolduc, and if they calculated the net loss percentage of putting him up front,"" the operative added. ""They'll realize at some point after the fact they made a mistake here.""

""Nikki is winning over Granite State voters of all sorts, from former Trump supporters to grassroots Republicans to Independents. That's the winning formula for beating Joe Biden in a landslide, which is what all the polls show she will do,"" a Haley spokesperson told CBS News.

Trump's campaign declined to comment on the dynamic between Bolduc and Sununu.

""Like Nikki, I believe that President Trump was the right president in 2016. I also supported Trump in 2020,"" Bolduc told CBS News. ""Unfortunately, President Trump over the last four years has not moved forward and has become more divisive. He is incapable of doing the most important thing for all Americans and that is uniting the country.""

""If America does not unify, we will destroy ourselves from within,"" Bolduc warned, calling on far-right Republicans, moderates, and further-left Democrats to come together to support her. ""We must come together for the future of our children and grandchildren.""

The strategy reflects an urgent desire to end the race quickly and avoid an extended and expensive battle for delegates heading into Super Tuesday on March 5.

Trump is facing 91 criminal charges in four jurisdictions, as well as two costly civil trials, where he has used voluntary appearances at New York courthouses this month as public relations and fundraising vehicles. But February offers him few such opportunities, meaning he would need to rely on his political strength alone to generate momentum for Super Tuesday, when voters in 16 states and territories will cast ballots for the nomination.

In New Hampshire, Trump began attacking Haley with paid advertising weeks ago, and intensified the onslaught more recently with sharper personal criticisms and campaign statements portraying her as a China-loving globalist. On Tuesday, he went after Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, on his social media website, using her birth name — Nimarata, which he misspelled as “Nimrada” — as a dog whistle, much like his exaggerated enunciation of former President Barack Obama’s middle name, “Hussein.”

And he has grown more aggressive on the campaign trail. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Wednesday night, he said of Haley, “I don’t know that she’s a Democrat, but she’s very close. She’s far too close for you.”

But his team is looking ahead to the South Carolina primary Feb. 24 as a “Waterloo” for his primary rivals, according to one Trump adviser, likening the state to the battlefield where Napoleon met his final defeat. Their aim is to humiliate her in her home state.

“South Carolina is where Nikki Haley’s dreams go to die,” another senior Trump adviser, Chris LaCivita, said in a brief interview.

Trump has been privately courting Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, hoping to win his endorsement before the primary. Trump allies who have relationships with Scott, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have been assisting the effort.

Republicans across the country, including senators who were previously skeptical of Trump, are assisting his strategy by consolidating their support, rushing to declare the race over, rolling out endorsements and demanding that his rivals quit immediately to “unify” the party against President Joe Biden.

Their efforts are being aided by the conservative news media, which has turned sharply against DeSantis after giving his candidacy favorable coverage early on.

The inevitability strategy also appears to be bearing fruit within the business community. On Wednesday morning, one of Wall Street’s most powerful CEOs, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase — who as recently as November urged donors to “help Nikki Haley” — praised aspects of Trump’s record and scolded Democrats for vilifying the former president’s Make America Great Again movement.

Haley and DeSantis both insist their campaigns are alive and well, with plans to compete deep into March. But the reality is that a comeback victory would represent one of the greatest upsets in modern American political history. That would be especially true if Trump wins New Hampshire, since no Republican who has won two of the first three traditional early states — Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — has ever lost the party’s nomination.

Haley finished a disappointing third in Monday’s Iowa caucuses but is facing what polls suggest is more favorable terrain in New Hampshire, where unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the primary and where her allies argue even a close second could provide a rationale to stay in the race. Even there, however, she needs a large turnout of unaffiliated voters to overcome Trump’s overwhelming backing from Republicans.

“She basically has to turn the Republican primary into the unaffiliated primary,” LaCivita, the senior Trump adviser, said of the state.

Haley’s path to a competitive race seems more visible than DeSantis’, but only barely: She must win the New Hampshire primary Tuesday or come in a very close second, and ride a wave of media momentum for a month before tackling Trump head-on in the state she used to govern, South Carolina, where he has a huge lead and endorsements from powerful politicians there, including the governor.

In New Hampshire, the Trump campaign is trying to engage what one adviser called a “pincer” — squeezing Haley from both ends of the ideological spectrum. An advertising campaign began lacing into her on immigration (hitting her from the right) before criticizing her for wanting to raise the retirement age for Social Security (hitting her from the left).

Haley is trying to portray Trump and Biden as two of the same: Disliked elderly politicians who are exacerbating chaos and division in America. It’s a message tailored for independent voters who have tired of Trump, but the message will most likely have far less purchase among Republican voters.

While Haley is courting independent voters in New Hampshire, it’s harder to see how a Republican candidate can win a Republican nomination without much stronger support from Republicans.

On Wednesday, Haley’s campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, rejected the notion that Haley’s strategy was to rely on independent and crossover Democratic voters to make up for softer support among Republicans.

Ankney said the strategy has always been to do well in New Hampshire, roll out with momentum into South Carolina and then go head-to-head against Trump on Super Tuesday, when independents have historically made a difference in open or semi-open primaries, including in 2016 for Trump.

Polls showing Trump far ahead in Texas and other Super Tuesday states should not be taken seriously, Ankney insisted, because “people have not started to pay attention” in those states and “there has been zero advertising.” The Haley campaign is optimistic that she can perform especially strongly in March states that have larger populations of college-educated voters, including Virginia.

Trump’s team is far less worried about DeSantis, who finished in second place in Iowa just 2 points ahead of Haley, but who is far behind in New Hampshire. The Trump team suspects DeSantis will struggle to keep his candidacy financially afloat long enough to compete seriously on Super Tuesday.

The DeSantis path beyond February is murky — a fact reflected by the pro-DeSantis super political action committee’s decision Wednesday to lay off staff in some of its March 5 states. But the DeSantis team insists the candidate has no plans to drop out before South Carolina.

“There is no mathematical pathway for Nikki Haley to win the nomination,” said David Polyansky, the DeSantis deputy campaign manager. “And even if she makes it to South Carolina, no amount of Wall Street money will bail her out from losing her home state, and then it will be a two-person race between Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump.”

A majority of DeSantis’ staff is moving to South Carolina, and he will mostly stop campaigning in New Hampshire after his events Wednesday, according to a person familiar with his plans, who insisted on anonymity.

The fact that South Carolina was his first stop after Iowa was described as an intentional signal about his electoral calculations.

On a staff call after Iowa, DeSantis’ campaign manager, James Uthmeier, described DeSantis’ view: The caucuses showed that Trump doesn’t have the standing he once did after getting just over 50%, and that Republicans want an alternative, according to people familiar with what was said.

DeSantis’ advisers remain furious at the Haley camp’s decision to spend more than $20 million attacking DeSantis on television ads before Iowa, which a top aide publicly described as “greed” before the caucuses and insisted was meant to help Trump. The DeSantis team has openly accused Haley of campaigning to become Trump’s running mate and not to win, a claim that she has denied.

In a late November phone call, days before the political network founded by the billionaire Koch brothers endorsed Haley, DeSantis had warned a Koch network operative that any money they spent aiding Haley and attacking DeSantis would only help Trump, according to two people familiar with the conversation. That’s because many DeSantis voters still liked the former president and would sooner peel off and support him than back Haley, who is viewed as more moderate. DeSantis told the operative that the money should be spent going after Trump, the people familiar with the call said.

The Koch network went ahead with its endorsement of Haley and put its expensive ground operation into her service, sweeping out across Iowa and New Hampshire in a last-minute sprint of door knocking.

Another element of Trump’s inevitability messaging is his growing discussion of possible personnel for a second term. Trump, who out of superstition has long avoided discussing who might serve in his administration, has begun indulging discussions of who might serve alongside him.

At his Iowa victory party Monday night, Trump brought onstage Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, who had ended his own presidential campaign and endorsed the front-runner. Trump told the audience that he had Burgum pegged for an important role in his administration.

Another former rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, immediately dropped out after the caucuses, endorsed Trump and urged all other candidates to do the same. As he appeared onstage with Trump at a rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire, on Tuesday night, Trump grinned broadly as the crowd chanted, “VP, VP, VP.”

“He’ll be working with us for a long time,” Trump said. It was a whiplash reversal that’s typical of Trump. Two days earlier, he had attacked Ramaswamy as “not MAGA.”

Such rapid consolidation of the party behind Trump has visibly frustrated DeSantis and his allies, given that less than a year ago there was a moment when it seemed as if Republicans might be ready to move on and coalesce around the Florida governor.

No defection was more emblematic of the shift than that of Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Lee was an early booster of DeSantis’ presidential run and had met with the governor to discuss policy, according to a person with direct knowledge, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private meetings.

Lee did not give DeSantis a heads up before he announced that he was endorsing Trump just three days before the Iowa caucuses, that person said. The DeSantis team saw the timing as a knife in the back.

Dan Hauser, a campaign adviser to Lee, said in a statement that the senator didn’t call any candidate in the race before he endorsed Trump.

In another personal twist, Lee’s wife, Sharon, had worked for the DeSantis super PAC, Never Back Down. She left the group “a couple of months ago on her own terms,” according to Hauser.

Committee Chairman Mark Green is heading toward a vote on Mayorkas' impeachment by the end of the month, setting up action by the full House as soon as February — which would be a first for a Cabinet official in nearly 150 years.

Green, a Tennessee Republican, opened the second impeachment hearing saying “no American is safe” under Mayorkas' handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, with a record number of illegal crossings. He argued that the secretary's “egregious misconduct and failure to fulfill his oath of office” are grounds for impeachment.

But the panel's top Democrat, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who has repeatedly insisted policy differences with President Joe Biden are not grounds for impeachment, was backed up by one of the witnesses, Princeton University law professor Deborah Pearlstein.

“Policy differences, no matter how profound, is exactly not what impeachment is for,"" Pearlstein said.

She argued that no branch of the U.S. government has more power than the Congress to set policy and that, with years of inaction on border legislation, those powers have “gone unused.”

House Republicans have been eager to impeach Mayorkas since seizing majority control last year, particularly as their efforts to impeach Biden over the business dealings of his son Hunter Biden have come to a standstill.

Accelerating the action in the new year comes as the focus on border security is driving the discussion on the campaign trail. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has vowed to launch the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history if he returns to the White House.

Biden told congressional leaders this week during a meeting at the White House he wanted a “big border security” bill as he tries to drive Congress to wrap up work on his $110 billion national security package for Ukraine, Israel and other needs, including the U.S.-Mexico border.

The leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, emerged cautiously optimistic, as Senate leaders eye a potential vote on that package next week.

But hours after the White House meeting, Trump signaled his skepticism toward any border deal, “unless we get everything” to shut down the migrants crossings, he wrote on social media.

Mayorkas has been deeply involved in Senate negotiations over the border security package, which would potentially restrict entry into the U.S. and more rapidly deport those people in the country without legal documentation. He has yet to appear before the committee for the impeachment proceedings.

Frustrated that Mayorkas would not appear Thursday, Green said the secretary is “stonewalling” the panel.

But the Department of Homeland Security said Mayorkas told the committee he was unavailable Thursday but would be willing to appear on other dates. The department noted he has appeared before Congress more than any other Biden administration Cabinet member — including 27 times in 35 months.

“This is just the latest example of Committee Republicans’ sham process,” department spokeswoman Mia Ehrenberg said. “It’s abundantly clear that they are not interested in hearing from Secretary Mayorkas since it doesn’t fit into their bad-faith, predetermined and unconstitutional rush to impeach him.”

One of the witnesses, Josephine Dunn, testified that her daughter, Ashley, died of a fentanyl overdose and said that she traveled from Arizona to appear at the hearing for the opportunity to question Mayorkas.

“Mr. Mayorkas is partly responsible for my daughter's death,” she said, calling fentanyl a ""weapon of mass destruction."" “Whatever he’s doing I hope is more important than that.""

Another parent, Tammy Nobles, had previously testified before Congress.

Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, shared his own family's experiences with the friends' lives lost to drugs and said he would bring the mothers' stories to his next meetings with officials from the U.S. and Mexico.

“This is the personal side of the chaos,” he said. “It has to stop.”

Several Democrats spoke of their own concerns with the situation at the southern border, particularly as drug cartels push the flow of fentanyl, even as they stopped short of blaming Mayorkas for the magnitude of the problem.

“Let's get it together,” Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., implored his colleagues, pointing to the federal funding battles coming this spring. “Surge resources to the border.”

Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., spoke of the pain of migrants fleeing their home countries and urged Republicans to come to the table with solutions. ""Work with us to pass legislation,"" she said.

Impeaching a Cabinet secretary has happened only once before in the nation’s history, when the House impeached Defense Secretary William Belknap in 1876 over kickbacks in government contracts.

It's unclear if Republicans, with only a very narrow majority in the House, will push ahead with impeachment if they don't have enough support from their ranks. So far, a handful of Republicans have expressed reservations, but some who initially voted to shelve the issue have indicated they are more willing to proceed.

If Mayorkas were to be impeached, the charges would next go to trial in the Senate, where it takes a super-majority to convict. In the Belknap impeachment, he was acquitted.

Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign staffer, filed the motion to disqualify Willis from the case earlier this month, accusing her of acting “to defraud the public of honest services.”

The motion asserts that Willis had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to oversee the case against Trump. Wade has been paid more than $650,000 in legal fees since January 2022.

During a speech this week at Atlanta’s Big Bethel AME Church, Willis defended the hire, calling Wade a “great friend and a great lawyer” who’s been paid the same rate as the other special prosecutors employed to work the case.

“I’m a little confused. I appointed three special counselors,” Willis said Sunday. “It’s my right to do, paid them all the same hourly rate. They only attack one. I hired one white woman, a good personal friend and a great lawyer, a superstar, I tell you. I hired one white man — brilliant — my friend and a great lawyer. And I hired one Black man, another superstar.”

Notably, Roman’s filing provides no hard evidence for the allegation, instead basing the claim on “sources close to both” Wade and the district attorney.

In a separate motion Thursday, Willis accused Wade’s estranged wife, Joycelyn Wade, of “conspiring with interested parties” in the election case “to annoy, embarrass and oppress” Willis.

Nathan Wade and Joycelyn Wade are currently in divorce proceedings after she had a romantic affair with a third individual, the motion further alleges, while accusing her of “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”

Even if there’s no merit to the claims, a delay in the trial against Trump could pay big dividends. Trump would presumably claim immunity if he wins the presidential race in November ― and could postpone a verdict until then.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee asked the state to respond to the claim by Feb. 2, with a hearing set for Feb. 15.

Meanwhile, the trial against Trump and 18 co-defendants ― including Roman ― for their roles in attempting to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election is tentatively set to begin Aug. 5.

JUST IN: Judge McAfee sets an evidentiary hearing on Mike Roman's motion to disqualify Fulton County DA Fani Willis based on alleged ""improper"" relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

Hearing set for 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 15.

(Reuters) -A judge in the Georgia election interference case against former U.S. President Donald Trump has set a hearing next month over accusations that the Fulton County district attorney and a top deputy had an improper relationship and mishandled public money, according to a court filing.

In a Thursday order, Judge Scott McAfee set a Feb. 15 hearing to discuss allegations by a Trump co-defendant who accused Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis of engaging in an ""improper, clandestine personal relationship,"" with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

The filing by Michael Roman cites unnamed sources and sealed records in Wade's ongoing divorce case.

A representative for Willis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Willis' spokesperson previously said the district attorney's office would respond to the accusations through court filings.

A lawyer for Willis said in a Thursday court filing in Wade's divorce case that Wade's estranged wife, Joycelyn Wade, is using court documents to ""annoy, embarrass and oppress"" Willis, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, citing a court document that the paper posted online.

The records in that case are sealed, and Reuters could not obtain the document.

Willis' lawyer could not be reached for comment, and Wade did not immediately respond to a voicemail left with his office.

Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, is accused along with 18 co-defendants of seeking to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state to President Joe Biden.

Trump and Roman have both pleaded not guilty.

Roman's filing claims Wade, a private attorney appointed by Willis to assist in the case, is not qualified for his role and been paid roughly $1 million, citing invoices attached as exhibits.

Trump often uses his legal travails to rally supporters and raise money for his campaign, denouncing the four criminal cases he faces as political witch hunts.

While he has not yet moved to disqualify Wallis, Trump will almost certainly cite the misconduct allegations as he seeks to discredit the case.

It would not end the case if McAfee disqualifies Willis, though it could lead to delays that might be helpful for Trump.

“They would probably appoint another prosecutor from a different county, so it wouldn’t mean the case is thrown out,” said Jerry Froelich, a Georgia criminal defense attorney who is not involved in the case.

Trump has separately been indicted in Washington for his efforts to reverse his election loss, in Florida for mishandling of classified documents upon leaving office and in New York for hush money payments to a porn star.

He has pleaded not guilty in all of those cases.

""A president of the United States must have full immunity, without which it would be impossible for him/her to properly function,"" Trump said in a lengthy post on Truth Social in all caps. ""Any mistake, even if well intended, would be met with almost certain indictment by the opposing party at term end. Even events that 'cross the line' must fall under total immunity, or it will be years of trauma trying to determine good from bad.""

""Sometimes you just have to live with 'great but slightly imperfect,'"" Trump added. ""All presidents must have complete & total presidential immunity, or the authority & decisiveness of a president of the United States will be stripped & gone forever. Hopefully this will be an easy decision. God bless the Supreme Court!""

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is expected to soon issue a ruling in the case brought by Trump in his effort to dismiss the federal election interference case against him. He has claimed that he should be immune from prosecution because his efforts to overturn the 2020 election fell within his official duties as president.

The judges heard oral arguments regarding the immunity question earlier this month and they appeared to be skeptical of the former president's position.

The court could issue a ruling that decisively resolves the immunity question, thereby allowing the election interference trial, scheduled to begin March 4, to move forward.

The judges could also issue a narrower ruling that could leave some issues unresolved. The court could also simply rule that Trump had no right to bring an appeal at this stage of the litigation.

It's likely, however, that the case will wind up before the Supreme Court, which sidestepped the immunity question in December.

The former president has argued that his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and his involvement with the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection were part of his presidential responsibilities. He has said that he was investigating election fraud as president at the time even though there was no evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump's Truth Social post came after he sat in a New York courtroom Wednesday in a trial to determine damages in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against him.

Brian Kemp told world business leaders Thursday.

Speaking as part of a panel focused on electric vehicles at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Republican governor highlighted the construction of the Georgia Power’s two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, near Augusta — the country's first new reactors in decades.

“We’ve done as much as anybody in the country ... but we’re going to have to have more,” Kemp said, although he did not call for closing any current power plants that burn coal, natural gas or oil.

It's Kemp's second year in a row to visit the forum of world business and political leaders. He told The Associated Press on Thursday in Davos that the trip is aimed at “really just selling the state from an economic development standpoint.”

That includes touting the electricity produced at Plant Vogtle. One of the reactors in the $31 billion project is generating power, while the other is expected to reach commercial operation in coming months.

“We’re letting people know that we got a great airport, great seaport, got a great energy supply with our two nuclear reactors that are online and coming online,” Kemp said.

The fellow members of Kemp's panel said that electric vehicles need to be made with electricity that isn't produced by burning coal, oil or natural gas that emits world-warming carbon dioxide. Zeng Yuqun, founder and chairman of Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, said a “dirty battery,"" or one produced with lots of carbon emissions, is “big trouble.”

“That’s why I’m looking for sustainability in all of this very quickly,” said Zeng, one of China's richest people.

Kemp, who said Georgia is “well on our way” to achieving his goal of being the “e-mobility capital of the world,” said he hears the need for clean energy from firms such as Hyundai Motor Group and Rivian Automotive.

“Talking to the companies that we’re recruiting, people that are looking to the state, they obviously want to produce with clean energy,"" Kemp said.

It's another instance of how Kemp has shied away from tackling climate change directly, but has welcomed some changes in the name of business recruitment.

The governor said he would look to electric utility Georgia Power Co. and its Atlanta-based parent, Southern Co., to meet those clean energy needs. But environmentalists have panned a current request from Georgia Power to increase its generating capacity largely using fossil fuels.

Kemp told the AP that he remains confident in his push to recruit electric vehicle makers, despite a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the United States. He blamed a law backed by President Joe Biden that included big incentives for buying American-made electric vehicles, saying it “tried to push the market too quick.”

“I think the market’s resetting a little bit now,"" Kemp said. ""But I do not think that’s going to affect the Georgia suppliers — everybody’s still very bullish on what’s going on in Georgia. And I am too.”

Kemp told the panel the biggest challenge in Georgia's electric vehicle push is making sure manufacturers and their suppliers can hire enough employees.

“That's the big thing for us, is making sure we have the workforce,” Kemp said.

Blinken's Africa trip comes as the United States is increasingly nervous about its relationships on the continent, particularly after coups last year in Niger and Gabon, and escalating unrest in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In addition, the U.S. and China are in a battle for influence throughout Africa. That topic will likely top his the agenda in Angola, which China has targeted for significant investment.

Blinken will highlight the administration's partnership with African nation on issues such as the climate, economic investment, food and health, department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.

While in Ivory Coast, Blinken may attend an Africa Cup of Nations soccer match between the host country and Equatorial Guinea.

During McCormick’s appearance on “The John Fredericks Show,” Fredericks asked McCormick how he would “stand firm to cut spending” once in the Senate.

“The No. 1 thing you do with a Senate majority and a House majority and a Republican president in the White House is you roll back all those incredible, expensive Biden bills — the infrastructure bill, the Build Back Better — all of that stuff, that’s the money that’s driving this huge uptick in inflation,” McCormick responded.

McCormick, who failed to capture the GOP Senate nomination in 2022, is hoping to unseat Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) in November. A victory for McCormick could virtually ensure a Republican takeover of the U.S. Senate during a cycle when Democrats are playing defense on a difficult map.

McCormick, right, and his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, attend a gala in Manhattan in June 2023. McCormick's position on infrastructure puts him to the right of 19 Senate Republicans.

But McCormick’s opposition to the infrastructure bill — and promise to repeal it — exposes him to political attack from Democrats, who are likely to paint him as a hardline conservative out of step with voters in a purple battleground state. (Contrary to McCormick’s claim, Build Back Better did not become law; a significantly scaled back bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, did.)

The infrastructure bill passed Congress in August 2021 with the support of 19 Republican senators and 13 Republican House members, including Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who hails from the Philadelphia suburbs.

“Senator Casey fought to make sure the bipartisan infrastructure law will deliver thousands of good-paying jobs in Pennsylvania for years to come,” said Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. “Meanwhile, professional job-killer David McCormick’s mission is to kill off every job in the Commonwealth, from laying off workers to outsourcing American jobs and now repealing the infrastructure law.”

McCormick’s campaign defended the candidate’s stance, citing a Kimberly Strassel column in The Wall Street Journal that said that less than one-quarter of the bill’s spending went to traditional infrastructure like roads, bridges, tunnels and waterways.

“While Pennsylvania’s infrastructure needs improving, a stunning 77% of the so-called ‘infrastructure’ bill that Bob Casey rubber stamped went to fund Democrats’ ridiculous climate pet projects rather than actual infrastructure in our communities,” Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick’s campaign, said in a statement. “At a time of historic inflation, Joe Biden and Casey increased the financial burden on taxpayers, once again failing the people of Pennsylvania.” 

Strassel’s op-ed in the Journal is based on a July 2021 analysis conducted by the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist think tank, that found that the bill dedicated $110 billion to roads, bridges and major construction projects, and $17 billion to ports and waterways. That means the bill would spend just $127 billion of its $548 billion in new spending on “items that most people associate with” the term infrastructure, according to Strassel.

The final version of the infrastructure bill created $566 billion in new spending. 

But even under the old total, Strassel’s math is misleading. Strassel, McCormick, and other conservatives object to the bill’s investments in electric vehicles, environmental resilience, public transit and a greener electric infrastructure.

But CRFB’s original analysis shows that the bill included plenty more in so-called traditional infrastructure spending than Strassel admits. Key line items include $66 billion for freight and passenger rail (the latter of which Strassel claims is only used by a small subset of the population), $25 billion for airports, $11 billion to improve road safety, $65 billion to expand broadband internet service, and $55 billion for water infrastructure, such as removal of lead pipes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are set to kick off an abortion rights campaign next week on the 51st anniversary of the now-overturned Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court ruling, with speeches by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as well as advertisements focused on women affected by Republican-backed abortion bans.

With Biden running for re-election in November and his party seeking to defend its majority in the Senate and regain control of the House of Representatives, Democrats are hoping the issue of abortion rights will prove to be a winner at the ballot box.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which was issued on Jan. 22, 1973. The Roe ruling had recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide. Since it was reversed, Republicans at the state level have passed numerous restrictive abortion laws.

Harris is scheduled to travel to Wisconsin on Monday - the Roe anniversary - to put a spotlight what the Biden campaign called a Republican ""all-out assault"" on reproductive rights.

The Biden campaign said that the president, Harris and their spouses will take part in a campaign rally in Northern Virginia the following day. A campaign press release said the rally is intended to highlight the stakes of the Nov. 5 election ""for a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions,"" citing ""the very possible reality"" of a Republican-led national abortion ban in the future contrasted with Biden's commitment to signing legislation that would enshrine Roe's abortion rights into law.

Biden aides think the issue of reproductive rights will be particularly potent in northern Virginia, where Democrats need voters from the affluent Washington suburbs to carry the state in the election.

Most opinion polls, including a Reuters/Ipsos poll in July, have shown a majority of U.S. voters expressing opposition to presidential candidates who favor strict abortion limits.

Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Biden, last week said he was ""proud"" of his role in overturning Roe. The three conservative Supreme Court justices who Trump appointed during his presidency were pivotal in the decision overturning Roe.

""Donald Trump is the reason that more than one in three American women of reproductive age don't have the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions,"" Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement, adding that Trump and his party now want to ""go even further if they retake the White House.""

""Trump directly paved the way for Republican extremists across the country to enact draconian bans that are hurting women and threatening doctors. In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country,"" she added.

Biden's campaign also said it will launch a new advertising campaign targeting women and swing voters in election battleground states, focusing on the personal impact that abortion bans have had on women and providers.

The overturning of Roe was a triumph for conservatives, but appears to have turned abortion into a political liability for Republicans. All seven statewide ballot questions about reproductive rights since 2022 have resulted in victories for abortion rights advocates, including in conservative-leaning states such as Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky.

Voter backlash on abortion rights also was credited by many political analysts with limiting the scale of Republican gains in the 2022 congressional midterm elections - though Republicans did win control of the House - as well as propelling Democrats in 2023 to election victories in Virginia and Kentucky.

The party has now secured at least 12 spots on ballots for the 2024 election.

Researchers previously noted that a third-party candidate would likely hurt Biden more than Trump.

As of Wednesday, ""No Labels"" has officially been recognized as a political party in Kansas, further paving the way for a candidate to make a third-party presidential run this cycle.

According to a press release from the Kansas Secretary of State's office, the party met the requirements to become a minor party in the state after submitting the number of signatures equal to about 2% of Kansas' 2022 gubernatorial election turnout, roughly 20,000.

With its recognition in Kansas, the No Labels party will now be on the ballots of at least 12 states, though the party's yet to endorse a candidate publicly.

In 2023, Sen. Joe Manchin — who's retiring at the end of his term — appeared at a No Labels fundraiser, sparking concern from some of his Democratic colleagues in Congress.

""If No Labels runs a Joe Manchin against Donald Trump and Joe Biden, I think it will be a historic disaster,"" said Rep. Dean Phillips in May, several months before he himself declared a run for president on the Democratic ticket against President Joe Biden.

""And I speak for just about every moderate Democrat and frankly most of my moderate Republican friends,"" he said.

The party may, ultimately, not choose a current Democrat for a White House bid. In July 2023, Business Insider reported that one of the party's leaders said the decision could come down to chance.

""It would be a very interesting experiment,"" said former Utah Gov. Jon Hunstman. ""Flip of a coin? How all major decisions are made.""

And though the party has said it's staunchly against former President Donald Trump's bid for office, Democratic strategists have warned No Label's efforts will only help Trump get re-elected.

In a report published Thursday by the Allbritton Journalism Institute's ""News of the United States,"" No Labels leader and former Democratic Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon suggested that while Republican Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in 2021, ""Democrats are contributing"" to the country's worsening political rhetoric.

""It wasn't a Republican who said Fetterman could wear shorts from sleeping to the Senate floor,"" Nixon said, in reference to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's move in 2023 to alter the chamber's dress code for Sen. John Fetterman, who's well known for his casual dress.

Vice President Kamala Harris has led the charge on the issue for the White House and will hold the first event in Wisconsin on Monday, which would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion.

Then Biden, Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will travel to Virginia on Tuesday for another campaign stop focused on abortion. It will be their first joint appearance for the 2024 reelection campaign.

Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court's conservative majority two years ago. Trump has taken credit for the outcome because as president he appointed three justices to the nine-member court.

Biden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement that Trump as president “paved the way” for “draconian bans.”

“In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country,” she said. ""These are the stakes in 2024 and we’re going to continue to make sure that every single voter knows it.”

Biden's campaign said its advertising campaign would focus on how abortion restrictions have affected women and health care providers.

In addition, several political allies — including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper — are hosting their own events focused on battleground states.

The Miami Republican David Borrero, an extremist who is simultaneously pushing a bill that would in effect ban all abortions in the state, also believes students are being “radicalized and evangelized” in Florida’s classrooms.

His proposed flag legislation – which advanced from a crucial rule of law subcommittee hearing on a 9-4 party line vote on Wednesday – would outlaw any flag that depicts a “racial, sexual orientation and gender, or political ideology viewpoint”. Teachers would also be prevented from wearing Pride or Black Lives Matter pins on their lapels if the legislation passes.

“Public classrooms should not be the place where our kids go to be radicalized and evangelized into accepting these partisan, radical ideologies,” Borrero said during the meeting of the constitutional rights, rule of law and government operations subcommittee.

“It’s wholly inappropriate to be putting those types of flags in front of public school students and in government buildings.”

Borrero’s bill would also prevent the flags at offices of state and local authorities, and public buildings throughout Florida.

Democrats pushed back against the proposal, the latest in a long line of attacks by Florida Republicans on LGBTQ+ rights. Other measures signed into law by the hard-right governor, Ron DeSantis, in recent months include the so-called Don’t Say Gay law banning classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare, and the banning of books, even including dictionaries, for perceived sexual or inappropriate content.

In the latest move against what DeSantis sees as “woke ideology” pervading Florida campuses, the state’s board of education on Wednesday banned public colleges and universities from using state or federal funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.

“The legislature has overreached to vilify diversity, ban books and shame our LGBTQIA youth and adults,” the Democratic state senator Tracie Davis said at a press conference in Tallahassee for Equality Florida, highlighting what it calls a Republican “slate of hate” of new anti-trans bills.

“Banning books does not ban LGBTQ youth or adults and it will not eliminate them. Restricting access to Black, queer and other diverse media does nothing to protect our children – it actually harms them.”

Another Democratic state senator, Shevrin Jones, who is gay, told the committee meeting that Borrero’s bill, which also seeks to ban lawmakers displaying Pride flags in their offices, was “authoritarian”.

“Are we in Cuba? Are we in Russia? That’s fascism at its best,” he said, noting he had a colorful Pride at the Capitol poster in his office lobby.

“How I was raised, the rainbow meant hope. I can promise you – it wasn’t that that made me gay. I’m not taking a damn thing down. I want everybody to see it.”

Parents who spoke at the hearing pinned the blame on DeSantis, pointing out that his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was tanking because the governor’s agenda is seen as too extreme.

“You are making enemies you are not supposed to have,” one father, who said he was a Republican, told the politicians, according to WFLA news. “We have seen proof that this has failed. DeSantis got the floor wiped with him, and you are anchoring your political careers to that sunk ship.”

The bill’s co-sponsor, the Republican state congressman Randy Fine, said critics “have no idea what they’re talking about”, and said he supported previously voiced comments that “the movement”, presumably meaning the LGBTQ+ community, was “trying to go too far”.

Michele Rayner, a Democratic congresswoman who is Black and lesbian, said she was angry that more anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was being introduced instead of measures to try to solve Florida’s affordable housing and property insurance crises.

“Once again, we’re focusing on things nobody has asked us to focus on,” she said.

The bill moves on for discussion in the Florida House’s state affairs committee, where its fate is uncertain. Similar legislation introduced by Borrero last year failed to advance from the same constitutional rights subcommittee it cleared on Wednesday.

The Democratic-led Senate voted 77-18 on final passage after considering a few amendments. The Republican-led House soon followed suit, passing it by a vote of 314-108.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law before the funding expires Friday at midnight.

It is the third stopgap bill since last September as the divided Congress struggles to agree on full-year government funding bills. Thursday's bill passed with mostly Democratic votes, with 107 Republicans voting for it and 106 voting against it.

A recent deal between Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on how much to spend in the new year has renewed hope of completing the process by the new early March deadlines. But that is far from guaranteed as right-wing House Republicans rebel against it.

The first stopgap bill led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker. His successor, Johnson, is seeking to avoid the same fate by selling the conservative victories in the latest deal.

Before the Senate vote, Schumer inveighed against “a loud contingent of hard-right rabble-rousers who thinks a shutdown is somehow a good thing.""

“In the twisted logic of the hard right, the theory is if enough people feel the pain of a shutdown, the hard-right can bully the rest of Congress into enacting their deeply unpopular agenda,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. “Bullying, intimidation, chaos. This is MAGA extremism in a nutshell.”

Around the same time, the House announced that it would cancel votes on Friday in anticipation of a winter storm and complete votes on the stopgap bill on Thursday.

The bill would extend the two-part government funding deadlines from Jan. 19 to March 1, and from Feb. 2 to March 8. The funding bill is unrelated to negotiations surrounding an immigration and national security supplemental bill that would provide aid to Ukraine and Israel. It's designed to give appropriators more time to craft the 12 appropriations bills that fully fund the government using the newly agreed-to spending levels.

“We need just a little bit more time on the calendar to allow that process to play out,” Johnson told reporters, saying he’s “very hopeful” that Congress can pass all 12 measures.

“We’ll see how this develops. Certainly, we’re not going to have an omnibus,"" he said, referring to the massive, last-minute spending bills Congress has frequently relied on. ""And that was a very important innovation for us to forge forward because it’s no way to run a railroad.”

, where it is expected to receive his seal of approval. During the special session this week, Landry has repeatedly urged the Legislature to adopt a new map that would satisfy the court, instead of possibly putting the task in the hands of “some heavy-handed federal judge.”

Louisiana is among the states who were wrangling over congressional districts after the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that Alabama had violated the Voting Rights Act.

Under the new map, 54% of the voting-age population in the district currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves would be Black — up from the current 23%. Graves opposes the plan, saying in a statement to The Advocate that it “ignore(s) the redistricting principles of compactness and communities of interest.” Other Republicans on the state House and Senate floors echoed this concern.

GOP state Rep. Glen Womack, who filed the legislation, said that race was not the “predominate factor” in deciding where the new boundaries would lie, but rather “politics drove this map."" Womack said he prioritized protecting the seats of U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as that of Congresswoman Julia Letlow, who represents Womack’s region and sits on the powerful House Committee on Appropriations.

Under the 2022 map, which was used in last November's election, there is one majority-Black district — the 2nd District, which encompasses most of New Orleans and stretches to Baton Rouge, and is represented by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter. Carter is the state's sole Black and Democratic member of Congress.

The 2022 map has been at the center of political woes in the state Capitol, with former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoing the political boundaries and the Legislature overriding his veto — their first override of a governor’s veto in nearly three decades.

In June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick struck down Louisiana’s map for violating the Voting Rights Act. Dick said in her ruling that “evidence of Louisiana’s long and ongoing history of voting-related discrimination weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs.”
